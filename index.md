# Description

Programming for historians. Using the power of programming to explore the past in brand new ways. Teaches undergraduate history students the basics of Python and object-oriented programming in order to gather data from online  archives, parse it, ananlyze texts and explore historical networks.

This course does not assume a technical background and is meant to be an introduction to programming and the concepts of the field of Digital Humanities. This course focuses above all on effort expended, creative thinking, and sound historical analysis.

The in-class course material is supplemented by the [repository](https://github.com/thePortus/programming-the-past), which powers both the [course website](https://theportus.github.io/programming-the-past) and [notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/thePortus/programming-the-past/master). The coursebook website contains information and lesson plans. The notebooks contain all the major code used in this class as well as extra lessons, all of which are marked up not only with comments, but also with explanatory notes in Markdown.
