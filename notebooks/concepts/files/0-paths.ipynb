    "Every file or folder has a \"path\" that points to its location on the hard drive. One problem though is that operating systems are very different. You might think you could manually type in the location of a file (e.g. `C:\\some_directory\\some_file.txt`), and this might work on your machine. But, you don't know if the code you write is going to be executed by someone else on another operating system. Linux and Apple machines use `/` to seperate each part of a file path, yet Windows machines use `\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good coder MUST make their code as broadly compatible as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you write your code so it will be able to open/save/files reliably no matter what the operating system? That is where the `os` module comes in, and it's submodule, `os.path`. It will offload the hard work, and make it quick and easy to not just make a file path, but also scan for and find files."

    "Sometimes you know that inside the directory (like the one from the previous step) there is another folder you want to point to. Perhaps there are files in it you want to look for. You might be tempted to take the result of the step above and add it to the name of the directory, perhaps something like `y = x + \"\\directory_name\\\"` but remember, operating systems work differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why we must us the `path` submodule's method `os.path.join()`. You need to send it two or more strings which it will join together with either `\\` or `/` depending on the operating system the code is running on. The first argument will be the root, which in this case is this directory, which we can find by running `os.cwd()`. The second argument we will send it will be the name of the subdirectory, which I already happen to know in this case, which is `sample_data`. `os.path.join()` will then compute the results and give me back the full and correct path pointing directly to the subdirectory, no matter what operating system this notebook runs on."

Fortunately, `os.path.join()` allows you to not only move 'down' into subdirectories, but 'up' into parent folders. All you need to do, is add `..` to the starting point path, which is shorthand to the computer to move up a level. In this case, our starting point will again be the current directory. But, you can do this at any point to any system path."
