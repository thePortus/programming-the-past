Ellen Klein: Today is March 15, 2011. I�m here today with Alexander Larys. My name 
is Ellen Klein. We are in Seminole, Florida, in the United States of America. Our
language is English, and our videographers are Jane Duncan and Richard Schmidt.

I�m here today with Alexander Larys, and he�s here to share his story with us. So, Mr.
Larys, tell us a little bit about yourself, if you would.

Alexander Larys: Well, you have to ask me the questions. (laughs)

EK: Okay, all right. Tell me your name and please spell it.

AL: Alexander�well, it�s really Alex, A-l-e-x, Larys, L-a-r-y-s.

EK: And what was your name before it was changed to Larys?

AL: Kupfer, K-u-p-f-e-r.

EK: All right. And what year were you born?


AL: Nineteen thirty-nine.
EK: All right. What was the date?
AL: January 9.
EK: Okay, great. And what were your parents� names?
AL: Well, it was�my mother�s name was Antonina; later she was called Nina. My


father�s name was Tadeusz; in the United States it became Ted.
EK: Okay. And how do you spell Tadeusz?
AL: I�m not sure. I would think that it�s T-a-d-e-u-s�that�s approximately.
EK: Okay, all right. And do you know when he was born?
AL: No, I don�t have the date.
EK: Okay. So I think maybe twenty-ninth of November 1904, does that sound right?
AL: Well, sounds all right to me, I don�t know.
EK: Okay. And your mother, what was her name before she married and became a


Kupfer?


AL: Oh, I don�t know�oh, wait a minute, Stoltzberg. You talking about her maiden
name?
EK: Her maiden name.
AL: Oh, Stoltzberg.



EK: Okay, and how do you spell it?


AL: And I�m not exactly sure, but I imagine it would be S-t-o-l-t-z-b-e-r-g. That�s the
way I spell it on applications.
EK: Okay, great. And where were they born?
AL: Well, they were both born in Poland, but where I don�t know.
EK: Okay, and how about you?
AL: Me? I was born in Krak�w, Poland.
EK: In Krak�w, okay, very good. And what do you remember about being a little boy in


Poland?
AL: Not much.
EK: Not much? Okay. What do you remember about your parents when you were little?


Who were they and what did they do?
AL: Oh, I don�t remember what they did in Poland. I left Poland at that age of four.
EK: And your mom, though, what kind of work did she do?
AL: She was a pharmacist.
EK: A pharmacist, okay. And what about your father?
AL: He was�well, he got a degree in economics, I believe, but he had a toy factory in



Poland: a small, small business.
EK: And he built them?
AL: Huh?
EK: He built the toys?
AL: Yeah.
EK: Yeah. Did he like his work?
AL: I don�t know. I don�t remember.
EK: He didn�t tell you. Okay.
AL: Oh, did he like his work?
EK: Yeah.
AL: I assume he did. I don�t know.
EK: Okay. (laughs) What do you know about your early life? What do you know about


being a boy in Poland?
AL: Oh, I don�t know. I really don�t remember anything. There was one incident, I


vaguely remembered it: I knocked something�I was left alone and I knocked something
over and I started a fire. It was a very vague memory.
EK: Yeah, your father said in one of his writings that you had to be left alone a good bit

when they were both working.


AL: Yeah, in the ghetto.


EK: For a very small boy. Now, your father was in the Polish army, right? What can you
tell us about that?
AL: He was an officer in the Polish army, which was actually unusual, for a Jewish


person to be an officer, considering that Poland was extremely anti-Semitic. As far as his


military activity, I don�t know.
EK: Okay. So, I read the story that he was a first lieutenant there when the Germans first
entered Poland, and that he was involved in a military action against the Germans that
became quite famous.


AL: Well, I don�t know about famous, but it was a small detachment from what I read
about it. Poland fell, I think, on a Thursday or first few days, so it wasn�t much of a war
for Poland. And he was guarding a tunnel: he detonated a tunnel impeding the Germans
from advancing faster than they did.

EK: And then what happened?
AL: Well, he said that he shot himself, but he missed his heart somehow.
EK: Why did he do that?
AL: He was�he didn�t want to be captured by the Germans.
EK: Okay. And so what happed after he shot himself?
AL: Well, he was in the hospital, and my mother somehow managed to get him out.
EK: Okay. And where did you go after that?
AL: I don�t know.



EK: Okay. So the record says that your family went to a ghetto, yeah? Bochnia?
AL: Bochnia.
EK: Bochnia, yeah. And how do you spell that?
AL: Oh, well, again, B-o-I would imagine c-h-n-i-a.
EK: Okay, that sounds right.
AL: That�s how I would spell it.
EK: Okay. And so your family�you were about a year old then, no?
AL: Oh, I don�t know how old I was when I went into there, into the ghetto.
EK: All right, so into Bochnia first. And do you know what your parents were doing


when they were there in the ghetto? Were they still working?
AL: Probably, but I don�t know.
EK: Okay, all right. Do you know how long they were in that ghetto?
AL: Well, in 1943 we were taken to Bergen-Belsen; before that I don�t know what


happened.
EK: Okay. So in some of the records we have from your family, it says that you were
first in the Bochnia Ghetto and then that that was liquidated, but that because your
parents were considered foreigners, your family was allowed to stay and you were moved
to the Krak�w Ghetto.


AL: Well, my father forged documents [that] supposedly we were Argentinean citizens.

EK: I see.

AL: At that time, if you owned property in Argentina you were considered�you could
claim citizenship, according to the way I understand it. So that�s�you know. But I don�t
know anything about moving from one ghetto to another.

EK: Okay, all right. Well, you were pretty young, right?

AL: Yeah.

EK: Yeah. (laughs) Little bitty boy. Okay, so he knew enough to know that Argentinean
status would allow you to stay longer, right, so he managed to get the papers?

AL: Well, supposedly a lot of people were doing the same thing; and most of them�for
most of them it didn�t work, because the Germans were up to it. Somehow�well, later
on, he thinks that what happened was�after we were on a train and were liberated, he
went over to the train to look through documents and he couldn�t find our documents. So
he thinks that what may have happened is that the Germans lost our papers and they
didn�t know what do with us. So that�s what he thinks.

EK: About why you were still together as a family and on that train together?

AL: Right. We were in the special compound at Bergen-Belsen.

EK: I see. Okay.

AL: Yeah, as a matter of fact, Frank Towers, the officer that was in the rescue�the
American rescue party�he has a list of survivors and it�s got my name on it; it doesn�t
have my parents� names on it.

EK: Okay, I can see why they would think maybe the papers had been lost. So back up a
little bit and tell me, do you remember anything from being in Bergen-Belsen with your


family?

AL: Well, I remember some incidents, but not a whole lot.

EK: What do you remember?

AL: Oh, I remember�now, one incident, I was playing with�I know there were a few
kids my age, a few boys my age, and we�re playing. I remember we were collecting
some things, I�m not sure. They probably were not cigarette butts because nobody would
have thrown cigarette butts out, so I don�t know what we were collecting. But I
remember one time I was on a sewer pipe, one of those red clay pipes that had jagged
edges at the end; it was broken at the end. And I was standing on it, and another kid
rocked the pipe and I fell and almost knocked my eye out; I still have the scar here. My
mother was a pharmacist, so she took care of me.

Another incident I remember, next�well, another incident, another thing I remember
was we were called out periodically, I don�t remember how often, for roll call outside.
They would call names out and take people�take them away. Now, we never knew�we
had�I had the idea that they were being taken to a good place, whatever that meant. But
we don�t know what really�where they really were taken. They may have been taken as
hostages, to exchange for Germans; or maybe they were taken to the extermination
camps, because Bergen-Belsen did not have gas chambers. People who�there were
about 30,000 people that died there, but that was mostly from illness and starvation.

So at one of those, I remember a friend, a friend of mine, was called out; and then either
that night or some nights after that, I had a dream that he came back and he came back
with a spoon. To this day I don�t know whether the spoon symbolized food or it
symbolized the fact that we didn�t have utensils.

EK: Or maybe both, right?

AL: I don�t know, but I remember�the dream was very vivid. I still remember it. And
the next day, when I woke up, I ran through the barracks looking for him: and of course I
didn�t find him, but I was sure he was there.

Another incident was next to�next to our compound, across from the fence, there was a
little barracks: it was some sort of a reception area. It was a fairly small barracks, and
people were lined up in the outside coming in and virtually everything was taken away


from them as they walked out the other side of the barrack. So people realized that they
cannot�that they�re not going to be able to keep things that they had. They threw food
to us that they had with them. And one time they threw a bag of rice and people fought
over it: it got torn on the barbed wire fence and the rice was scattered. After all the
commotion ended and everybody was gone, I went over there and I collected grains of
rice one at a time, and then my mother cooked it.

EK: That�s very resourceful, as a little man.

AL: Anyway, and I do remember�I don�t remember any brutality on the parts of the
Germans. I remember that people were dying and if someone died�now, you probably
know better than I do; you�re religious, right? They laid people out naked on a bench and
wash them; was that a religious ritual? Yeah, I remember that. And they probably died
from�I didn�t see anybody shot.

EK: So do you think that you were kept with your mother because of your special status
as foreigner?

AL: Right. Well, as a citizen of a friendly country to Germany. Argentina at the time
was neutral. Yeah.

EK: And where was your father?

AL: Oh, we were all three in the camp. Now, whether�we were together in the camp;
whether we�I don�t know what the sleep, the dormitory situation, was.

EK: Okay.

AL: You know, setup was we were all in the same compound.

EK: Okay. And do you remember when they had you all gathered together to leave
Bergen-Belsen?

AL: No.


EK: Do you remember being on the train?

AL: I remember being on a train and I remember that it took days; now I know it was
about a week. But we didn�t get very far from Bergen-Belsen. Well, this was two weeks
before the end of the war, approximately two weeks. The Russians were�and this was
near the Elbe River. The Russians were coming from the east and the Americans were
coming from the west. So the train was�they didn�t know which way. Oh, they put us
�there were three�they loaded three trains, with the destination being Theresienstadt,
Czechoslovakia.

EK: Okay.

AL: Which was still in Nazi hands, securing�it was secured for the Nazis. One of the
trains, now, I found out that one of the trains ended up�it was liberated by the Russians,
so they ended up with the Russians. I don�t know about the third train, but our train was
going back and forth; they weren�t sure where to go. And then suddenly a small
American detachment came by accident across the train, and that�s the train near
Magdeburg.

EK: Okay. And do you remember that? Do you remember when they came?

AL: Well, I remember that the train was made up of both cattle cars and passenger cars.
We were in a passenger car. So I remember we were sleeping outside�we were outside
the train�and I could see warfare going on, air war going on above us. And then
suddenly a child, about ten years old�well, that�s what I was told�came running down
the hill saying, �Americans are here.� And it was sort of a small hill, it wasn�t much of a
hill, and a lot of people ran up, including myself. I remember running up there, and I
remember seeing one American tank and a Jeep. And they had about a dozen Germans
lined up with their hands over their head; they took their belts off and threw it to us.
Purpose of that was, I imagine, so they won�t escape, so it�d be harder for them to run
away.

And they put�the town where the train was, that place was Farsleben, which was near
larger town called Haldensleben, which had a military�a German military camp. And I
believe that that�s where they put us up, where we stayed. And both these towns are near
the larger city Magdeburg.

EK: Yes, okay. Do you remember how that felt for you?


AL: No.
EK: No, okay.
AL: And I know my father later said that he went back over there looking through the


papers and he didn�t find our papers. That�s what made him assume that the Germans


lost our papers and they weren�t sure exactly what to do with us, so they just held us.


And while he was over there, somebody took a shot at him, but missed. The war was still


going on.

EK: Somebody took a shot at him after the liberation?

AL: Well, the liberation was of the train.

EK: Right.

AL: Yeah.

EK: Okay, so while you were waiting there in Farsleben.

AL: Right.

EK: Okay. And do you know how long you were there?

AL: Not really, probably just a few weeks.

EK: Okay, and then what happened?

AL: Well, then what happened there I heard recently from the people who were on the

train, and from the Americans. Well, we were in an area, there was�where the

Americans were going to pull out and the Russian army was going to come in. So they


gave us the choice of either going west or east; some people went east with the Russians,
and we ended up in Belgium. How we got there, I don�t know.
EK: Did your father or mother say why they chose to go?
AL: To Belgium? No.
EK: No, okay. Just didn�t want to go to the east with the Russians.
AL: Right.
EK: Okay. And what do you remember of Belgium? Where were you in Belgium first?
AL: In Antwerp.


EK: Okay, and do you remember anything about that?
AL: Well, very little. I remember I went to school there, in French, even though Antwerp
was predominantly Flemish. But I was in a�actually, it was a Jewish school�I still
have some documents�Tachkemoni.


EK: Right, okay.
AL: You�ve heard of it?
EK: No, you told me about it.
AL: Oh. So that was in French.
EK: Was that your first experience in school?
AL: Yes.



EK: Yeah. What was that like?
AL: What was it like? I don�t know. But I remember one interesting incident. They
made us memorize things; you had to recite from memory. I never memorized it to the
end, and one time they called on me and when I got to the point where I�memorized up

to that point, they said, �Okay.� Now, maybe the teacher figured�I assume that the
teacher figured that�s enough, (laughs) but I always wondered about that incident.
EK: What do you think was happening there?
AL: With that incident?
EK: Yeah, that you wondered about.
AL: Oh, well, probably the teacher realized that I probably don�t know any�didn�t


memorize any more, but they assumed that was enough, probably. And there was not�
you know, it was not coincidental that he made me stop there.

EK: Okay.
AL: And we were in Antwerp�I don�t remember exactly how long: about half the time
in Belgium, which was about�we were in Belgium for about four years, three, four
years, half in Antwerp and the other half in Brussels.


EK: Okay. And do you know why they moved to Brussels?
AL: No.
EK: Okay. Were your parents working? What were they doing?
AL: My father, in Brussels, he was working in the diamond industry.



EK: Oh, okay. Sure.


AL: He got�he probably worked as a contractor. I remember he had this long stick onto
which you mount the diamonds and you grind them on a machine.
EK: And how about your mom, was she working?
AL: At that time, I don�t know if she was working. I don�t think so. I don�t know. I don�t


think so.


EK: Okay, all right. And then when you were in Brussels, what else happened? Your
sister was born, no?
AL: Yeah, but she was born in forty-nine [1949], so that�s about four years down the way.


I mean, if you want to hear funny stories�
EK: Sure.
AL: I remember I had a cane, a toy cane, and it was an old apartment and there was this


�what do you call those things in wood, eyes or something? And I poked on it (both
laugh) and it went through and the neighbor came up. I knocked part of a ceiling down.
EK: And you were in school then, yes, in Brussels?
AL: Oh, yes.
EK: Yeah, okay. What grade were you in then, do you know?
AL: Probably second and third. And I was sent back one year, I don�t know why.
EK: It was also in French?



AL: This was all in French, yeah, in Brussels. So I spoke French fluently, but I forgot it
all.
EK: What do you remember about school in Brussels?
AL: Not much.


EK: What do you remember about family life?
AL: I don�t know. I remember that my parents sent me to a Christian camp, not because
it was Christian but that was probably the only camp available, and I remember that I
wasn�t too excited about it. Even at that age, I knew that I was Jewish. And I guess it
must have been on Sundays when people were taken to church, and I was the only one
standing, kept standing when people were kneeling, and people looked, turn around and
looked at me. I remember one time when my father was about to visit�I expected him
to visit�I hid in the bathroom not to go to the church. (laughs)

EK: So was your family religious, or no?
AL: No.
EK: No, okay. And then you had a sister.
AL: Yeah, she was born in forty-nine [1949].
EK: In forty-nine [1949]. And what�s her name?
AL: Well, her name then was No�lle, because it was a custom that if you�she was born


on the twenty-fifth [of December], Christmas Day. It was customary for people born in
Belgium then to be called that, No�l, No�lle. But now her name�s Hannah.
EK: Hannah, okay.



AL: Changed it.
EK: Yeah, okay. So what happened after Brussels? Where did your family go?
AL: Israel.
EK: You went to Israel. What made your parents do that?
AL: I don�t know. (laughs)
EK: We don�t know, okay. So this is forty-nine [1949] or after forty-nine [1949] that you


immigrated to Israel?


AL: I was always confused about it. It was either�was probably 1950, because�yeah,
must have been 1950.
EK: And did they have family there, is that why they chose to go?
AL: There were some distant relatives, yes.
EK: Okay. And so, do you remember anything when you first came to Israel?
AL: Well, initially we were in an immigration camp�
EK: Where was that?
AL: In a tent. I think it was either called Be�er Ya�akov, or it was near Be�er Ya�akov. I


think so. At first we were in a tent; then we were in a one-room building�I mean,
buildings: one room was assigned to us.
EK: Okay. And then your parents did what? What kind of work did they do there?



AL: I don�t know.
EK: And you went to school?
AL: I don�t think I went to school, and I don�t even remember how long we were there. I


don�t remember going to school, so I don�t know.
EK: Did you speak Hebrew?
AL: Probably not.
EK: Yeah. So that might have made it hard, right?
AL: Yeah, I doubt that I spoke Hebrew, �cause I certainly didn�t learn Hebrew in


Belgium.
EK: Right. How long do you think you were there?
AL: I don�t know, but probably not long.
EK: Okay, because what did your parents want to do? Where did they want to go?
AL: Oh, I don�t know.
EK: Were they trying to get into the United States?
AL: Well, I think that maybe they applied when we were in Belgium; they may have


applied to immigrate to the United States on the Polish quota, which at that time was
eight years, I believe.
EK: I see. Okay.



AL: So we went to Israel, and then I assume that eventually our name came up, possibly,
and that�s what we came to the United States.
EK: I see. Okay. Do you know what year that was that you came to the United States?
AL: Yeah, fifty-four [1954].
EK: In fifty-four [1954], okay. And you were on a certain ship, yes?
AL: Yeah, the Andrea Doria, before it sank.
EK: Before it sank, that�s a good thing. (laughs)


AL: Two years before�it sank in fifty-six [1956], I think.
EK: Okay, so fifty-four [1954], all right. So, what do you remember about coming to the
United States, and where did you come first?


AL: In United States we came to New York, Washington Heights.
EK: Did you have family there?
AL: No, my father had a friend in Queens who sponsored him.
EK: Okay.
AL: How we ended up in Washington Heights, I don�t know.
EK: Okay. And what did your father do for work, and what did your mother do?
AL: My father got into the garment industry; he was a designer, a cutter. And my mother



got a job at�I don�t know whether initially, but she worked at the Columbia Medical
Center in research.

EK: Okay. Yeah, from her pharmacy experience, right. Yeah, okay. And did you start
school?

AL: Yeah, right away. Oh, yeah, there was an interesting incident when I walked up to
George Washington High School in New York, and I was walking late. When I got there
it was sort of on the late side, and there was a teacher there, standing�whose duty was to
check on latecomers, I guess, I don�t know what the position is. And I came up to him
and he asked me a question, and it turned out that he was a Hebrew teacher, so I was okay
there with communication. (both laugh)

EK: Right.

AL: And as a foreign language I took Hebrew, so that was easy.

EK: Okay, all right. And how long were you there in New York?

AL: In New York?

EK: You finished high school there?

AL: I finished high school, and I�I finished high school in two years because I was two
years behind to start with, so they put me through an accelerated, two years and two
summer schools. And of course foreign language I did very well in, which was Hebrew.
And then I started at City College [of New York] in engineering, studying engineering for
year and a half, and then I got tired of school and went into the army for two years. And
then I came out of school�out of the army�and went to a college in California for one
term, and came back to New York and finished, finished my degree.

EK: All right, and then what did you do?

AL: After I finished my degree in engineering? Yeah, I think that�s when I got a job with
Bendix electronics, and I didn�t like it. I wasn�t doing anything, that�s why I didn�t like


it; it was pretty boring.
EK: And this was in New York?
AL: Well, in New Jersey.
EK: In New Jersey, okay.
AL: Right near New York�well, within commuting distance.
EK: Sure.
AL: They really had nothing for me to do, they just�at that time, there was plenty of


government money fueling these companies. So I quit that, I don�t remember the exact
dates now. Well, I started�well, I quit that job, and even with my degree, I drove a taxi
for a while to save up money to go to Israel. I went to Israel on a trip. And then I went to
California and then I came back to New York, and by accident I got a job teaching at City
College, providing that I went on for my master�s degree. Since I didn�t know what else
to do, I did that.

EK: Right, okay.
AL: I did that for a year and a half. Then I went to Israel again. This time I�let�s see,
I�m getting confused with the dates, but�oh, yeah, that must have been sixty-nine [1969]


I went to Israel for a year and a half. When I came back, I went into my own small
business in the security field, servicing and installing intercoms and alarms.
EK: And that was in Israel or in New York?
AL: In New York.
EK: In New York, okay. So you were only in Israel for a little while.
AL: A year and a half.



EK: Okay.
AL: So here I was way overqualified for my work. By then�at some point there, I finish


my master�s. And I was in the business of servicing and installing security fields�
security alarms and intercoms in New York.
EK: Okay. And did you go back to Israel after that?
AL: In seventy-three [1973] during that war I went over. I got there on the last day of the


war. As soon as I landed, they lifted the blackout.
EK: They did? (laughs) Okay.
AL: They knew they were safe. (EK laughs) No, but seriously, there was a blackout in


Israel at the time, and the day I landed they lifted it.
EK: (laughs) Okay, it might have been you.
AL: Might have been me, probably not.
EK: So is that when you joined the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]?
AL: No, actually I was in the IDF in sixty-nine [1969].
EK: Oh, okay.
AL: Within the framework of reserves. Well, this time, also, I went in for a month or


two. I was in. Then I only stayed in Israel about six months, came back to the United
States, and since then I�ve been going there for every year for�it depends, sometimes
longer. There was a period of time I kept an apartment there, and I would go two or three
times a year for a month or two at a time.


EK: Okay, all right. So this story of the train was something that only for a fairly recent
amount of time has something that�s been known, right?
AL: Right.
EK: Can you tell about how that came to be, that this story was brought to light?
AL: Well, first I�ll relate�I�ll say how I found out about it.
EK: All right.
AL: This was two years ago? Either a year or two years ago, we were�


Unidentified Woman: Two years ago, I think, by now.
AL: Two years ago we were in a hotel in�what do you call it, Floyd? No. What�s the
name?


Unidentified Woman: Perry, Florida.
AL: Perry, in Perry. We were in Perry, Florida, watching the network news Friday night.
And, you know, they had this story about this train that was liberated and it looks very
familiar to me. I said, �Wait a minute.� So then I checked out on ABC, checked the story
out, got some information about�well, then I found out that what was going on is that
about three years prior to that, I believe it was�it was a teacher up in Upstate New York
that had a project on the Holocaust. And one of his students came to him and told him

that his [the student�s] grandfather was involved in rescuing people off a train. So that�s
how this started.
EK: I see, okay. So they interviewed him, and who was that, do you remember?
AL: Do you remember his name? I have the information.



EK: So it was one of the tank�
Unidentified Woman: Teacher�
AL: Ah, the teacher.
Unidentified Woman: His name.
EK: Rozell, yeah, that�s the teacher.
AL: Yeah, Rozell.
Unidentified Woman: Matt Rozell.
AL: Matt Rozell, that�s the teacher. No, he was not a rescuer; he was just the teacher�
EK: No, I meant the gentleman that he interviewed that had been there. Was he not one


of the tank drivers?
AL: Oh, that�s right. Yeah, he was one of the tank drivers, who�s still alive, lives�his


name is Walsh, Carl Walsh, and he lives right nearby in Saint Port Richey [New Port
Richey]. I saw him twice, recently.
EK: And that started something, didn�t it, because they had a reunion?
AL: Well, they had this on the Internet, so a lot of people found out, like myself,


contacted them, so you had this reunion and�that�s right, they had a reunion in that place
in New York. I don�t remember the name of it.
EK: Hudson Falls.
AL: Hudson Falls. Well, actually�wait a minute. What I saw on TV was that reunion.



EK: I see.

AL: It was about that reunion. So maybe that it all started right there and not few years
before. But anyway, at that point, I looked up the name Frank Towers and Carl Wash.
Carl Walsh was a tank commander; Frank Towers was sort of a logistics officer, he was
coordinating things. And he was�

EK: He was infantry, right, an infantryman?

AL: Yeah, it was part�they were all part of the 30th Infantry Division that landed in
Normandy and fought across Europe and came to�their objective there was to get to
Magdeburg, which was a sizable military objective, and someone told them that there�s
this train. So Carl Walsh got an order to follow this Jeep with another tank and they went
over to see what the train was all about, and that�s how those two tanks and a Jeep came
across the train. And Frank Towers, well, I�ve seen him three, four times.

EK: So learning about that led to your own reunion with him, yes?

AL: Right. And the 30th Infantry Division, they have their reunion, an annual reunion,
and last year I went to it. It was in Nashville and there were about four train survivors, or
maybe more. But three of them were my age, except they were not in my compound, I
don�t think.

EK: You didn�t recognize them?

AL: Well, I wouldn�t have recognized them, but you know, we could have exchanged
stories, maybe. Maybe some of the stories we would have remembered. But I�m pretty
sure that there were�first of all, they were Hungarians, and they were in the Hungarian
compound. Let�s see, what else? I don�t know.

EK: Well, what was that like, to meet him, to meet Frank Towers, this person who helped
liberate you and your family?

AL: Well, interesting. He�s in good shape. He�s ninety-four years old.


EK: That�s impressive.
AL: But you know, he doesn�t jog every day, but he�s active.
EK: But how did you feel? How did you feel when you met him? What�s that like? That


has to be a pretty incredible experience, to meet a man that�
AL: No, not to me.
EK: No?
AL: No.
EK: Okay, all right. So what do you do with all this, with this history?
AL: What do you mean what I do with it?
EK: Well, what�
AL: Well, what I just told you earlier, that there�s a reunion in Rehovot.
EK: In Israel?
AL: In Israel at the Weizmann Institute, May 18, and I�ll be there for two weeks. And I


think that the American consulate will be there, the American ambassador; there�ll be a


few dignitaries at that meeting. Frank Towers will be there, and there will be a number of


�well, a lot of the people that were on the train, a lot of them do live in Israel. I have a


list of some of those people. And so a lot of them should be there.

EK: But it sounds like maybe that�s become important to you, to participate in that, if
you�ve been to a number of reunions.


AL: Yes.
EK: Tell me about that.
AL: Just did. (laughs)
EK: Why is that important to you?
AL: Oh, I don�t know how to answer questions like that.
EK: Yeah. Not sure?
AL: Right.
EK: Okay, that�s all right. So is there anything else you�d like to tell us? Anything else


you�d like to share?
AL: No, that�s about it from�relating to that.
EK: Okay, all right. Thank you so much.
AL: You�re welcome.
EK: Okay.
