Chris Patti: �with survivor Elisabeth Dixon. My name is Chris Patti. We are in Tampa, 
Florida, in the United States. The language is English, and the videographers are Jane
Duncan and Richard Schmidt.

Okay, Ms. Dixon, thank you so much for spending time with us today and for telling us
your story, and for driving all this way to the University of South Florida.

Elisabeth N. Dixon: You�re welcome. I�m looking forward to this.

CP: Well, I am, too, and we�ll start off real basic. Can you give me your name right now?

ED: Elisabeth, spelled with an s, not a z. And I use N. as a middle name; it�s the first
letter of Nichtenhauser. That�s a little bit too long to keep it. And Dixon.

CP: And you had a different name at birth. Can you tell us that name?

ED: Alice Leopoldine Franziska.

CP: Franziska. And Nichtenhauser?


ED: Nichtenhauser.
CP: And that is spelled N-i-c-h-t-e-n-h-a-u-s-e-r?
ED: Yes, it is.
CP: And I think the only other difficult to spell�Leopoldine, is that L-e-o-p-o-l-d-i-n-e?
ED: Yes, sounds good. (laughs)
CP: Okay, okay. And when were you born?
ED: May 21, twenty-eight [1928].
CP: Okay, and that makes you eighty-three today, is that correct?
ED: Yes, it does.
CP: All right. And where were you born?
ED: I was born in Vienna, Austria.
CP: You�when we talked on the phone, you had a really kind of�even though you


didn�t live in that area for very long, you had a good description of where you were born.


Do you remember that at all?
ED: Well, it was the important place in Austria. Everybody wants to be in Vienna. It�s a
marvelous city. The Donau�Danube�goes through it. From what I was told�because I
was just a baby when we left anyway, but we were near the Prater, which was�they had
a reason�I can�t think of the other word. But it was like a fun park sort of thing; it was
quite famous. And it seems the family had�the living quarters looked down onto all that.
They had a very lovely time at that time.


CP: And you were born in Vienna, but then you soon moved about twenty miles away?

ED: To M�dling.

CP: To M�dling. And that is M-� with an umlaut-d-l-i-n-g.

ED: Yes.

CP: How old were you when you moved there?

ED: I would think only a few months, actually. I have no recollection of when we moved.
I just know that that�s where we went. (laughs)

CP: And how would you describe your hometown, where you grew up?

ED: Well, that was�I think it�s�the best thing about it is that it wasn�t too far from
Vienna. It was maybe a twenty-minute train ride and you�re back in the middle of Vienna.
The whole town was situated at the foot of the Vienna Woods, and it was a very pretty
place. It was not too big and not too small. It was just a regular little town.

CP: Do you remember, you know, the kind of people that were in the town? Was it a mix
of all different sorts of people, or was it�?

ED: I think it was a mix. There were shopkeepers, you know, and among them there were
Jewish people. I wouldn�t know any other people as far as their beliefs or something; that
came later. It came out with a bang what they really were. But they all seemed very nice.
My father had to rent a smaller place for his business. His business was selling radios at
that time, and music players, you know, the old fashioned way. And he was content there.
He made friends, and he was very kind to the people. It was not a rich area or anything. It
was still hurting from the loss of�what do I call it? I don�t know. Well, everybody could
make a living, you know, it was that kind of place. There was a railroad station in the
bottom corner of M�dling. You know, for me it was just a very little place. That was my
world.


CP: When you were really young, did it feel kind of like a safe world? Did you feel like

you didn�t have anything to worry about?
ED: No, not really, except that my mother and father were divorced, so they were living
separately. My mother was living about�I would say about maybe a half hour away
from M�dling, and where she lived it was called Brunn am Gebirge. (laughs) That was a
much smaller town. And there were times that my mother had fights with my father. I
think when I was that little, I was living with my father in M�dling. And he had to have a
housekeeper, because you know, he had his business in the same place where we lived.
We had a one-bedroom place�I have a painting of that, if you�d like to see it.

CP: You actually brought the painting?
ED: Yes.
CP: Oh, excellent. We�ll look at that at the end of the interview. Can you tell me, what


was your father�s name? It was Alfred?
ED: Alfred.
CP: And your mother�s name was Ana?
ED: Ana.
CP: A-n-a, and what was her last name? Wenzlik?
ED: (corrects pronunciation) Wenzlik.
CP: Wenzlik. Is that W-e-n-z-l-i-k?
ED: Let me see it. Where am I looking? Oh, that looks very good. Yes.



CP: Okay, okay. And it seems to me when you told me your story the first time that your
story has a lot to do with the difference between your mother and your father, and what
happened between them during the kind of history that was going on around you at that
time. So can you tell me a little bit more about what was going on in your town, as well
as what was going on with your father and mother when you were growing up? You told
me that your father�s music shop was the only place where people could go to hear music
anymore. Can you tell me about that?

ED: That�s because it was the Depression, you know, and it wasn�t a rich city to begin
with. Yeah, my father was a very loving and understanding sort of a man, and he loved
music. He played music to the people. They asked him to play; you know, they missed
music. The Austrians do love music, generally. That hurts when they can�t have it. And so
he had arranged to�somebody, one of his pals, put something together that it would�
the people could come around and be outside and just listen to the music. It would come
through a speaker, I guess, to them.

CP: When did things start to change when you were young? Because you said your father
was identified as Jewish; you said according to Hitler, he was Jewish, but he wasn�t really
a practicing Jew.

ED: No.

CP: So when did he get identified as such, and when did things start to change?

ED: You mean when the people realized he was Jewish?

CP: Yeah, realized he was Jewish, and when the sanctions started coming in to your town,
is that right?

ED: Not until the Anschluss. Overnight, all of a sudden, they looked up the Jews, and
there were quite a few Jews still in that area. And that�s when Hitler talked about, and so
on. But I can�t tell you too much of the history, because I was just a little kid. I didn�t
know what was going on.

CP: You mentioned that you�when you were young, you had Christmas in your house.


ED: See, my mother was Aryan. She is�was Aryan. So we had a Christmas tree, you
know. But I didn�t know that we were �Jews.� I wasn�t brought up to go to a church or
anything. I just was.

CP: Do you remember at all what you were feeling or thinking when things started to
change? You said things started to change overnight. What happened to you, and did your
father talk to you about any of that? Do you remember any of that?

ED: You know, my young days when I was still able to see my father and my mother, he
�oh (laughs). I lost my train of thought.

CP: That�s okay.

ED: Tell me again what you want me to do?

CP: What were you feeling as things started to change? It must have been pretty radical
for you, because you were growing up and you weren�t even really thinking; you didn�t
know what Jewish was necessarily, and then all of a sudden your father was leaving.

ED: Oh, what I was going to tell you was that I was a child that was seen and not heard. I
never recall that either one of them would sit down with me and talk to me about
anything. It�s not that they didn�t love me, I suppose, but it just wasn�t done. So I just did
what I was told (laughs) and that was it. But if you could have asked my brother, who
unfortunately isn�t with us anymore, but he knew�he was older than I was, five years
older. His name was Hans, and he knew the history and everything. And he wrote a book,
too.

CP: He was interviewed, also, by the Shoah Foundation. Is that correct? Your brother?

ED: Yes. I don�t know what the place was, but he has been�he was interviewed.

CP: And Hans is short for Hansel, is that right?

ED: No, Johann.


CP: Oh, Johann, okay.

ED: He was Johann Paul, Paul. (laughs) That was his name. But he changed his name
when he grew up and so on, because he was a writer and he had a family. Nichtenhauser
is a very long name to grow up with. So he changed his name to Hans Knight, K-n-i-g-h


t. So he became Hans Knight. Just because I might mention him sometime later, so that�s
why I thought I�d tell you.
CP: Thank you. You told me a number of other stories about your childhood and about
your father in particular. Do you remember talking about Beggars Monday? Can you tell
me about that?

ED: Yeah. Well, there were very, very many poor people. The real poor ones were just
beggars. But they only allowed them to come around one day a week, so there wouldn�t
be beggars all over the place. What it entailed, as far as I could see, they were allowed to
go to the stores and just put their hands out for a few pfennigs, for anything. But that was
only for one day a week. And so when I was�I don�t know if I was not going to school
already or something, but I remember one of those Mondays. My father said, �Would you
like to do the Beggars Monday?� and I said, �Well, yeah.� And so he said, �Well, you
know��I said, �What do I have to do?� and he says, �Nothing. You are giving away.
They will tell you what�s going to happen.� And so I stood in the open doors of his store,
and he gave me a little�like a little ashtray or something, with small change in it. He
said, �Don�t let anybody take more than they should, you know. Make sure that you give
it out evenly, so we can give to as many as we can.� And that�s what I did on Monday,
and I stood there and I saw all these people. They�d done that before, you see. And they
would come by and take some pennies, you know, and thank you. That was it. And then
later on, of course, I realized that we were quite poor ourselves. (laughs) I said, �How
much do I have to give it away?� My dad said always, �As long as we have something,
you share it.� That was him, you know. He was such a good man.

CP: It sounds like he was a caring and a generous man. He cared about his community.

ED: Yes!

CP: And you said that the non-Jews of M�dling turned overnight, all of a sudden, and
people that were your father�s friends all of a sudden weren�t associating with him. Can
you tell me a little bit more about that?


ED: Well, you see, we never knew till that�I don�t know the date that it happened. It just
seemed that overnight, there were swastikas all over the place, and people running around
and �Heil Hitler,� people who you�d never think would ever do anything like that. But
there had to have been some subterranean arrangement, you know, because it was just too
sudden. You never saw a swastika or anything. But that was the beginning of it. And a lot
of people didn�t think of my dad as Jewish. He wasn�t a practicing Jew, so it never
occurred that it would end the way it did.

CP: Once he was labeled a Jew, then he had to move his store, is that correct, and paint a
�Jew� on the window? You mentioned that. Is that right?

ED: He had to move. Yeah, he had to�they closed his store, because they stole
everything. You couldn�t refuse them if they wanted something and they knew that you
were Jewish. They just helped themselves to anything. So this M�dling store was
emptied, and all of a sudden they labeled him. �Hey, Alfred!� And then, of course, he had
to be able to feed still my brother; he was still a boy, a schoolboy. And what�s gonna
happen to me? They had two children. So it was a terrible time for them. So he tried to
open a little store further�still in M�dling, but off the main street. He was on the main
street before. And that�s where�see, that was�have I mentioned two friends of his, who
stuck by him for quite a while? One was the ice cream man that had the ice cream shop.

CP: Is that Toegel ?

ED: Toegel, uh-huh. And the other one had a store where they sell�I can�t think what it�s
called. There were cases like that. Mr. Toegel couldn�t figure what was going on. He
never thought of Dad being a Jew. I mean, it just never came up. So he was of the opinion
that this would be a nice�the things that were going on right then there would simmer
down, and life would go on, really, just a little bit different. So he decided to volunteer for
one of the Nazi things, you know. I don�t know what branch. But he thought that if he
showed the rest of the people that you can do that and still live and be a decent person.
And he had a red convertible, which was a very unusual thing in those days. So he asked
my dad and Hans�I wasn�t involved in that. I don�t think I was, or maybe I was in the
car. And he drove us through the town, waving to everybody. And all of a sudden, he was
proved wrong, because the next thing we knew, he�d vanished. They picked him up, and
he wasn�t Jewish. He was gone for weeks, and nobody knew where he�d gone. And all of
a sudden, he was back again, but he wasn�t the same man. He never spoke of anything.
Nobody ever knew what had happened to him. And he was a broken man.


CP: When we spoke over the phone, you said that it was�it was like when you beat a
dog: that�s how he was after he came back. He just wasn�t the same.

ED: That�s right. But not towards our family, just generally. He couldn�t understand that
this would be so awful. And that was only the very beginning.

CP: That was one of your father�s friends, you said?

ED: Yes.

CP: Was there another person?

ED: Yes, Dundalek or something like that. Yeah. Similar, but he had�he was a quieter�
no, he wasn�t a quieter man. He was a fun-loving man. He used to entertain me when my
dad used to visit him sometimes, you know, from one store to the other, chatting. He�d
take me with him, if I happened to be living with my dad. And he would jump up on his
counters in the store, and dance and sing and everything. (laughs) His wife then had to
come in from the back�they were living behind the store�because she realized that I
was getting afraid, because he was dancing on his showcases, you know, and being funny
in his way. She knew that I was afraid that he would fall or something, and so she�d come
out from her apartment and simmer him down. (laughs) But again, Jewish/not Jewish
didn�t come into this.

CP: Was that the man who you said pretended to be a Nazi at one point, Dundalek?

ED: No. That was the ice cream man.

CP: Oh, the ice cream man? Oh, he was the one who pretended to be a Nazi.

ED: Yes. He put a uniform on, you see, and he wanted to show the people that he loves
them anyway and so on. It was just a uniform, and this was just something new.

CP: Oh, okay. But then he learned otherwise, like you said.


ED: Well, yes, because I think they taught him what he was getting into. And he was a
broken man. They left him alone then, �cause he wasn�t Jewish, but he just�I�m sure he
had some tough times with them.

CP: And so as things began to deteriorate, did your father�he had a sister, is that right?

ED: Oh, yes. He had a few sisters. Helene was the main one that he was with, yeah.

CP: Can you tell me that story, why he was talking with the sister�and didn�t he try to
move in with his sister, is that right? Can you tell me about that?

ED: Well, that was when everything was just terrible. We were missing something about
the other little store that he rented after the main street one.

CP: Yeah, please tell me about that.

ED: The little one.

CP: So�yeah. He had a third store, is that right?

ED: Yeah. Well, from Vienna and then M�dling, and still M�dling but in another place.
That�s when�I just looked it up the other day. They went�you know, the Nazis went
around, and if they could find a Jewish person they would either say�write on the
window or something, �Jew! Don�t go here!� and all this sort of stuff. And so this third
place that my dad moved to�real tiny, and Hans was living with him then. I guess I was
living with my mother at the time. They, um�what was I telling you?

CP: The third store. You were living with your mother and her sister.

ED: Oh, it was�my father and Hans always thought that it was her�the friend he had,
the ice cream man. His only thing he could do for his friend Alfred was to have a very
small notice put in his window, because other people, you know, they had the notice. And
so my brother used to tell me that the Nazis used to come around and see that everybody
had these signs that should have had the signs in the windows. They suspected�well,
they knew, or they thought that this old friend had something to do with just having them


have the small thing. But when they came to inspect it to see if they�re following the
rules, they would give him the size that he should have had. And so my father put it on
the window, not to get any more trouble than he had. But as soon as they would go away,
he�d say to Hans, �Take it down.� (laughs) And then if they went by again and said,
�Where is it? We don�t see the sign,� and he�ll say, �Oh, Hans�it just fell down.�
(laughs) �Put it back up.� So, you know, he had a sense of humor, too. It helped him.

CP: A sense of humor, and a really serious situation at the same time.

ED: And my brother loved that about him you know, about Dad.

CP: Did your brother take after your father, do you think?

ED: Yeah, a lot. Music. He just looks a lot like him�looked a lot like him.

CP: So you were talking about how your father ended up moving in with his sister.

ED: Well, that was�that came quite a bit later.

CP: Oh, okay.

ED: He couldn�t even keep that little store that I�ve been telling you about. Nobody came,
and they robbed everything there again that he had. And so he had to�he thought that if
they went into Vienna�there were a lot of Jewish people there, and maybe they would
get lost in the crowd somehow, you know, and they would feel safer there. So that�s what
they did. And he knew that he had a sister who lived there, and she had�she was renting
an apartment, and lived there many years, I guess. It was a very meager sort of place. She
never had a great deal of money.

He asked her, of course, if he could come and live with her, and she was glad that he
would do that because, unlike my father�you know, the typical thing they used to say,
�You look Jewish.� My father never did look Jewish. I�ve got photographs of him. And
she did: she had the red hair that they expected Jewish girls to have, and she just had, you
know�she was brought up to be a Jewess. So, that was her. So she was afraid to go out
in the streets, even if she could, because they were always looking. There were Nazis
walking all over the place all the time. The slightest thing they would see, they would go


after them and they�d disappear. And of course, she lived alone; she was a widow, but she
did have two sons. One of the boys was called Karl, and the older boy was Robert. The
young one was fortunate enough to have people who took him to�I think he came to
America straightaway, because they had friends there and they realized how things were
happening in Europe, and they kindly offered to take Robert and Karl. They both went to
�it was either England or straight to the U.S. I really don�t know.

But so she was living alone in that little place she had, and she said, �If you would come
and live with me��she was very frightened all the time. Because he didn�t look like he
was Jewish, she felt very safe with him. She said, �Of course, you can sleep here. I have a
little side thing.� It wasn�t actually a bed; it was like a couch type thing, and it was small,
but he wasn�t a big man, my father. And so that�s�she said, �I can�t even go shopping.
I�m afraid they�ll pick me up, you know?� So he would start doing things for her. I don�t
know for how long they did that. It was a considerable time, a year or two or so, but I
can�t be sure exactly how long.

CP: But he moved in there to help her out with the dangerous things.

ED: Yes. Yes. And of course, he had no income. He had no store, and nothing left from
his radios or anything. So I guess they just, you know�she gave lessons. Oh, what is that
thing? The making of hats, what do you call that?

CP: Oh, I forget what a hat maker is called.

Richard Schmidt: Haberdasher.

CP: Haberdasher?

ED: No. No, no, that�s clothes. But the hats�you know, it�s an art to making hats, ladies�
hats and things. And she taught that to a few young girls who wanted to do that, so that�s
what her income was. They would come to her apartment, and she would give them
lessons on that. So she got the little money that they could both eat; you see they just had
to get together. And then it just got worse. He would�my father would�that wasn�t
enough for them to live on, you know, a few pennies here or there. And she had to pay
rent, you know, too. And so he started looking in newspapers to see who had been�who
had left their place to live, because a lot of Jewish people, if they could afford it and they
had sense enough, they could leave at that point. So they would advertise their�he
would see this is an empty place, and then he would somehow try to notify people who


were looking for a place to live, and he�d get a few shillings. They�d be very grateful,
because Vienna didn�t get any bigger, you know. (laughs) And so that was his side
income. He didn�t just sit home and do nothing. And Hans and Karl� Helene�s little boy;
he was about two years younger than my brother. They were teenagers by that time. Oh,
gosh. I�ve lost my track of thought.

CP: That�s okay. I�m actually wondering about you at that time, and we�re kind of
jumping around a little bit in time here. But there�s a couple of things you said to me
when we first talked that really stuck with me. A couple of them were�you said that you
had a �double bad youth,� because you had your parents�they were getting a divorce,
but also the world was sort of falling apart around you. And you said, �I never knew
where I was. I felt I was a nuisance.� Can you tell me about that?

ED: Yeah. (laughs) Yeah, I just didn�t know where I belonged, you know. I knew that
everybody was having a bad time, but I had no way of knowing what could be done about
it or anything. And then this thing with my mother and father�my mother, she tried to�
she did. She took me away in the middle of the night, and she kidnapped me from my
father�s place. God knows why; I don�t know.

CP: Do you know about how old you must have been?

ED: For that, I was about four years old, because I remember her coming into the house.
We called it the house, the place where we lived, where my father lived. And she woke
me up�I was asleep�and she brought�she put my clothes; she found them somewhere
in the bedroom, I guess, and she started dressing me. And I was sort of dozing; I was half
sleeping. It was a very cold, rainy sort of a night. She looked upset. She wasn�t saying�
they must have had a terrible row about something that I wasn�t aware of. She was still
upset, you know. Once she gets upset, she was always very upset. She just grabbed me
and ran out of the house with me, and she jumped on�no, how did she get there? I don�t
know if she took�we didn�t have a bus. Tramways we had. Yeah, I think that�s what it
was, from M�dling to Brunn, where she lived then.

She got off the tramway at a certain place: there was a little store there that was an ice
cream store. It was raining and everything. She was still upset. And she ran into that
store, and she said, �Help me, help me. There�s a man following me,� and she was crying
and everything. She started�they told her she could stay in the store, I guess, and
simmer down and all that. But I seem to remember, even as little as I was, there was a
station for the tramway; it happened to be you can change tramways. They had a little
shelter outside to wait for the next one or something. There was a light to light it up so
you knew where to get on the next time. And you know, she was just grabbing me all this


time. I didn�t know what was the matter with her. As I told you, they never told me
anything. I just saw what was going on, and I didn�t know what was happening. I was
really little for that, you know, to know.

And I could see�there was a nice, big window in that store, and I could see the roof of
the station that you could stand. I could see my father, and he had just a suit on, and a hat.
He was dripping with water. And unfortunately�I�ve written all that myself sometime.
But I never knew what happened after that, because I fell asleep again. Now, that�s what I
mean. I was pushed from one to the other for one reason or another.

CP: It sounds like, from what you�ve told me, from a young age you identified more with
your father than your mother. Is that true? Your mother seems to be more absent than
your father.

ED: Yeah, that�s true.

CP: Why do you think that was? Do you have any idea?

ED: Well, my mother was so different from my father. I mean, inside, you know. I don�t
think she would likely give away even pennies to anybody. When she married him, she
got into the business with him. She wanted to do things, you know, and my father was
more saving things; he�d already done. He was about twelve years older than she was, in
the first place. But maybe I�m rambling too much.

CP: I don�t think so. I�m asking you some kind of in depth questions. I appreciate it. Your
parents, they separated when you were young, and then your mother got remarried, is that
right?

ED: Not for quite a number of years, but she had a male friend, yes.

CP: And you said that he couldn�t get work. Do you remember that? Can you tell me
that?

ED: Well, he was an engineer, and he was an Aryan. A very brilliant sort of brain he had.
He was a nice guy, but they just lived together, you know, for as long as they were in
Brunn. And I think I wasn�t�I was a problem for her, because he used to come and stay


with her and everything, and he didn�t like that, I don�t think. He liked her, not me.
(laughs) I mean, he didn�t mistreat me or anything, but it was just a sense that he didn�t
want me there. So whenever I could, I guess I�d stay with Papa.

CP: But you would go back and forth, a little bit?

ED: Yeah, a little bit. Mainly when she was angry at my father: she�d come to M�dling
and start a row, you know, and yell at the maid we had, the housekeeper. My mother was
very clean and very special, you know; everything has to be just so. (laughs) And she
would go in without telling us she was coming; she would just surprise us sometimes, and
go through the little apartment we had, and ran her fingers around the furniture to see if it
was not dusty and that sort of thing, and then yell at the maid. And she in turn, whoever
she happened to be at that time, would run downstairs and into the shop where my father
was, crying. I mean, my mother liked to have a flare up. It was none of her business, but
that�s what she was like. So the only times I ever saw them was if they�d been fighting.

CP: Well, I think what we�ll do is there�s a lot more of the story, mostly when you go into
the convent and your family goes into hiding. We�ll get to most of that, I think, after, on
the second tape. But is there anything that we missed about your upbringing or what
happened before you went into the convent, before you went into hiding that you�d like to
talk about?

ED: Um�

CP: That�s always the hardest question. (ED laughs) That�s the end of the interview, when
you say, �Did we miss anything?� and they�re like, �No, we got this.� Is there anything
else, any other memories that you have from when you were young, that you�d like to
share?

ED: Yeah. Let me see. I would just like to tell you what happened when my father
decided he had to go to Vienna to his sister, because he had Hans, you know, he had to
take his son with him. And that was the beginning of the real struggles for Hans and me.

CP: Why didn�t he have to take you with him as well? I�m wondering. Why did he just
take Hans and not you?


ED: Well, because maybe she wouldn�t let him. I mean, she was very on and off. It was
just a weird situation. In those days there were no divorces, you know, and things. And
she had married into a Jewish family, and they loved her and they were very good to her,
and she loved them. But it had to be her way, you know, or nothing. And to tell you the
truth, of course, Hans was always her favorite. I didn�t ever feel that she liked me, loved
me.

CP: Wow.

ED: I was just a nuisance, you know?

CP: And so to have that going on, on top of all the other stuff.

ED: Then it gets to the really tough part.

CP: I think that�s a good place to break, and we�ll get to the tough part after lunch.

ED: Okay.

CP: Thank you.

Part 1 ends; part 2 begins.

CP: Okay, this is tape two with our interview with Elisabeth Dixon, and we were just
kind of wrapping up your childhood until right before you moved into a convent. And
you were telling us a little bit more about your mother and her friend that became her
husband. Could you tell me a little bit more about that, and how you got into the convent?
What led up to that?

ED: Oh, yes, I think I can. Yes, absolutely. Let�s see. (laughs) My mother had to earn her
own living, really, because she wasn�t married then. Her friend was very loyal to her and
so on. So she had�Mother had a small little store that she opened in Brunn. In that store,
all she could do was�you have to think back to the old-fashioned ways of listening to
radios and things they used to have. Well, things would go wrong with the radios, and she
could fix little things. There were�I can never remember what it was she used to do for
them, but it may come to me later. But so Friedl, who�s her friend, he also didn�t have


any work. Couldn�t find anything, for anything. So he decided�between them, they
decided that the only way they could ever change anything was to get out of Austria. He
would have to go to Germany. And so�am I saying that right? And so he said he would
give it a try. He�d go first and see if it was any different in Germany. Well, Germany was
very busy, and quite a lot of chances of getting work, the kind of work he needed to get.
He was an electrical�

CP: Engineer?

ED: Engineer. And so I remember him taking off. They had a motorbike. (laughs) So
strange. So he took the motorbike, and he motorbiked to�I don�t know where it was
exactly. Berlin or somewhere, I don�t know. And my mother stayed back, because they�d
had the clothes. They opened a little store for him in Enzersdorf. There was nothing doing
there, you know, so they had to close that up, and he said he would have to go to a
different place; it just wouldn�t work. So, off he went, and he struck it fine. I.G. Farben
took him on, grabbed him.

CP: That�s a big company?

ED: Oh, yes, it�s a huge company. And he started writing back to Mama, you know. �Oh,
this is wonderful here!� Suddenly, there was nothing like poverty anymore in his life. He
made so much money, compared to the way it was; he was speechless sometimes. But he
just kept bombarding, with, �You have to come and join me! You have to come! I need
you here. I want you out of the other place.� So my mother was living in part of a very
pretty house that was very close to a convent, still in Brunn. She was friendly with the
owner of the house, and they became friends. Two women, you know. And so she used to
speak to her about everything. I was too young to assist her or anything.

So, how did that go? I happened to be living with Mother at that time. I was just playing
by myself, you know, but I knew that she was in the basement�which was not really a
basement; it was just a little bit lower. It was a place where they store things in the house.
And she was chatting to this friend, and she was talking to her about Friedl, that he wants
her to come and he wants her to come. And she at first was reluctant and kept putting him
off, and he was just getting hysterical waiting for her. And I heard her say to this friend,
�You know, he sent me a letter the other day, and he said if I don�t come soon, he�s going
to kill himself.� He�s not the kind of man you�d ever think would kill himself, but he was
just crazy about her. And she said�and she was standing there, over boxes. I could see
that myself. She knew I was around, you know, but like, �be seen and not heard.� She
pointed to them, because the friend said, �What are you doing?� She said, �I�m packing.
When he says that he�s gonna kill himself, what can I do? I�ve got to go.� And that�s


where it started. That was one of her big problems, was me. He didn�t say, �You and
Lilly.� That�s my nickname, by the way, Lilly. And I wrote in my book that I�m writing, I
think I said�what did I say? Oh, I can�t get it. Oh, I don�t know.

But anyway, she had this big problem. Where am I gonna be, because Hans was with
Father now and Hans was starting high school or something. There wasn�t room for me.
So, I said she always would find ways to have her way. (laughs) She found a way to get
rid of me, really. So she decided that it�d be a good idea if she got me in the convent: a
sleep-around place, you know. I think when she divorced�I don�t know who divorced
whom, but when she left my father. I don�t think you could have divorces in those days.
But she always said she was divorced, so everybody thought she was. She was Catholic,
and she�I�ve seen her�I used to see her once in a while to go into the church and pray.
I never saw her go to mass, so I think they excommunicated her, whatever she did with
her marriage. I don�t know if they had such a thing. But so that was how it was.

And she went to see the head priest, you know, in the town, and spoke to him about her
problems. Was there any chance that my little girl could go in the convent? Well, you
know, I was never christened. I was never a member of any church, knew very little about
religion at all, any religion. And so she had a number of interviews with him, and she
could be very persuasive. So finally she told me that we�re going to see this priest so-andso�
I don�t remember his name. �He wants to see you.� So I had to be interviewed,
(laughs) and he decided that I�d be a fair sort of a candidate.

CP: Did you know why you were being interviewed? Did you know that you were going
to possibly�

ED: No. I heard her say, you know, when she was packing. What could I do? And I
thought about it, and when I wrote it, I said�I can�t remember again. I thought that since
she is so fireball-ish, you know, with all her plans and everything, she was just talking
and she would never leave me. But I was wrong. She left me. But I don�t know what kind
of a story she told to the priest; I have no idea. He said, �Yeah, we can let her board, but
of course she has to be christened. She has to be taught��something else. And it was
settled. That was it. I have no idea if she even had to pay him anything. I never saw or
heard anything about that. I doubt that she could, because she didn�t have any money. I
don�t know what story she told him.

So the arrangements were made that that�s where I was going. And she said, �You
know��see, in that convent there were girls; it was just girls. Not many, it wasn�t a huge
place. Maybe in one of the better times there were maybe ten, ten of us in there, maybe
fifteen. All ages, you know, till when you were ready to go to high school or something. I


think they couldn�t take it anymore. But they teach you, and you sleep there and just live
there. And a lot of the girls had parents who had stores, shopkeepers. They could afford to
pay, you know. And so these parents would bring the girls on Monday morning or Sunday
evening, but pick them up for the weekend to be at home, because their work or
something allowed them to be at home with them. But so they were sort of semi-total
livers there. (laughs) And she said, �At the weekend when I don�t have the store anymore,
when it�s not open��I didn�t know she didn�t have it anymore. But she said, �When the
store�s closed, I�ll come and get you and you�ll stay with me for Sunday, and it�ll be nice,
nice food and everything.� She talked me into it. Well, I had no choice; I mean, that�s
what�s gonna happen, and it happened.

My problems started then, because in the first place, I told you�or I didn�t even say it
yet. My mother was a very good cook and a wonderful housekeeper, and she cooked stuff
that I liked, or I liked things that she cooked. She cooked with oil. Now, to me, that was
important. In the convent, they used any kind of fat. Well, that didn�t agree with my
stomach�I wasn�t used to it�and so, I couldn�t eat the food. So, I didn�t eat. I couldn�t
eat. That was gonna be a problem. So the nuns told her that if I don�t start eating, she
should take me out. She decided that she would bring things that she had cooked every
day, and then I could eat, just till I got used to it. I mean, I thought it was forever, you
know, but it wasn�t. So she would bring me gurkensalat�it�s cucumber salad; that still is
my favorite salad�and a dish called eiernockerl. It�s dumplings, and then it�s covered in
beaten-up eggs. And the two together make a very nice meal, if you�re used to that kind
of food, and that�s what I was used to.

In the beginning, it worked, and then gradually I would say, �Where�s my food?� and my
mother said, �Well�� I said to my mother, �Why didn�t you bring it for me?� and she
would say, �But I did. I did, I did.� It just dwindled away till I didn�t get it anymore, so I
had to sit and eat what they put in front of me. I was so�I don�t know, I guess I had a
sensitive stomach or something, but I would vomit. I couldn�t eat the stuff that they gave
me. And so the nuns were very strict people, I found out, as far as children were
concerned. So they couldn�t figure out what to do, you know. �Oh, gosh, she won�t eat
this either.� They started to put the works on me. What they would do is make me sit at
the table where the others had been sitting, and I had my own spot there, and I upchucked
everything. They made me sit there, and they just made me sit there. The other kids were
running away and everything; I had to sit there and just look at my plate. (laughs)

So that went on for quite a while. And then they said that can�t work, either. So, what was
it now? They said, I think, at that time, that if I didn�t start eating, I would not be able to
go home for a day or so, a week. And Mama came to see me, and she would talk to me
and say, �I want you to come home.� Little by little, that�s how they weaned me to eat
their food in the convent. You know, children can get used to most things, if you do it


long enough. And her visits, my mother�s visits, taking me home weekends, just
dwindled away.

CP: You said you were always the last kid to go home.

ED: Mm-hm. Well, when I�d be there, Friedl was there, and I know he didn�t feel
comfortable around me. He wanted just to be with her. So anyway, finally she got�the
nuns and my mother, I don�t know what they did, but we agreed to just stay there and do
what they tell me. I was always told to do whatever I�m told, and I always did that in the
end, anyway, �cause I wanted to please everybody. You know, you feel wanted, really.

CP: Because you must have felt so isolated and alone.

ED: Yeah. So anyway, that was one thing. She then went away; she went to Germany.
She fell into that wonderful life without any difficulties, because they could now buy a
car, which is something you could never do in Austria at that time the way they were. He
had had a motorbike, and he was lucky he had that. But not anymore: he had a car, and I
think he even bought a little boat.

CP: Do you remember feeling any resentment about that: that you had to live alone,
really, as a kid, and your mom was out there living this kind of lavish life?

ED: Exactly. Exactly. And she�by this time, of course, M�dling and all those places
were overrun with�no, not quite. The Anschluss hadn�t happened yet. But yeah, you see,
I was out of everything. I didn�t have a family. But before she went, I must say, before
she went to Germany, she used to�I brought pictures; I can show you later. Her little
store that she kept in Brunn was down on the main street of this little place, and she
would walk home and pass the convent, and then the house that she lived in was just a
few houses away, so she lived very close to the convent. When she didn�t use to get me
out anymore�you know, often�she decided�she said, �I can see where you�re
sleeping,� because for some reason I ended up near a�I have a picture, I think, of that
too. But I could see the road from the window, the big windowsill, and I could crawl on
there and I could see her. And she would then say, �I will wave to you, close to your
bedtime.� We had to go to bed early anyway, in the convent, and she could close her store
whenever she wanted. And she would stand there at the bottom and wave to me, and I
would wave back.


But then there came times when I didn�t see her anymore. Then, that�s when she left for
Germany. Of course, there were no ways that�I didn�t hear, you know, I didn�t get a
letter from her, nothing. I didn�t even know where she was until she would write to me,
so I did get that eventually.

CP: You said even the letters stopped after a period of time, right? You were in there for a
number of years.

ED: Two years.

CP: Two years. Did you have friends while you were in there, or did you feel different
from the other girls?

ED: I was different, because most of them went home sometime or another, for weekend
visits to their families.

CP: Did they tease you?

ED: No.

CP: Or was it more out of, you know, you were kind of�you didn�t have too many
friends?

ED: No. No, the girls were nice. They were all right, except the one. Our upstairs there
was a fairly large room, and there were all the beds for everybody and so on. And next to
it was a smaller room: it had two beds in it. After I had been there a while, I considered it
my luck that the girl�one of the girls who had one of the two beds was taken out. She
was maybe too old or something; she didn�t come anymore. And I got that bed. The girl
that was with me, she was a little bit older than I was. She knew my secret of waving to
my mother�we kept that a secret�and she started to wave to her, too, to my mother,
because I said�I think I felt that she felt it was her mother waving to her, too. Everybody
was lonesome, really. I wasn�t the only lonesome child, I think, but there were different
reasons and different degrees of loneliness. So, we became friends.

And all of a sudden she came back from her home stay�she was gone a whole weekend,
every weekend; they took her away�and she said, �I want to share a secret with you,


too.� And I said, �Well, what is it? What do you want to tell me?� We weren�t supposed
to speak�once we were in the bedrooms, it�s finished for the day�but we could whisper
because we were the only two people there. And she said, �Well, I have something, and I
need your help with it. I made it.� I said, �Well, what did you make? What happened?�
She said, �I�ve been�you watched me bring little things from my house when I come
back every week.� I said, �I didn�t know what was in your little bag.� And she said,
�Well, I�ve been secretly bringing wire and big glass balls, and then some different sizes
of those balls, and some string and that kind of thing. But now it�s finished, so now I need
your help.� So I said, �What do you want me? What did you do?�

She showed me this thing: she bent the wires, �cause she had no tools or anything, and
she made a ball with certain distances, so that the bigger balls�the balls would have to
be willing to fit, to come through, if she moved this thing, but not really out. It�d still be
inside, but they would have enough room to sort of come out a little bit. And I said,
�Well, what are those things doing? What are you doing with that?� She said, �Well, I
have to cleanse myself.� She decided that she was an evil person�they were all evil
persons, you know, in the convent, (laughs) that�s terrible. And she said, �I know that
there are some saints who will appreciate my doing this to myself, but I can�t do it
enough. I want you to do it.� I said, �What do you do with it?� She said, �Well, I get hold
of the string�it�s attached there�and I do this on my back. I throw that thing on my
back. But that�s so hard to do. I want you to do it for me.� I said, �No! I won�t do that!�
And that broke up our friendship.

CP: Because you wouldn�t cleanse her of her sins with her mortification thing? Wow.
And she was about your age as well?

ED: She was maybe a year or two older than I was. I was eight; from eight to ten years, I
was in the convent.

CP: And you wouldn�t do it just because you didn�t want to hurt your friend? You didn�t
believe that it was helping her?

ED: Well, I didn�t care her reason for it, but I wasn�t gonna hit her and draw blood and
stuff. But you see, in the convent you get all kinds of weird things�at least then you did;
I don�t know anything about it now. But that always stuck with me. They�re very�my
experience was I saw too much�just sort of weird results of when these nuns would do
something that normally wouldn�t be done. There was one girl�I think her name was
Martha. Very quiet, very nice girl; always does what she�s told, and smart and nice. And
that poor girl, she had one fault: she was a bed wetter. They would tell her, �Don�t do
this,� da-da-da, but she couldn�t control it somehow, and she would do it every day. So


what they used to do was take her in the upstairs place where they used to do the laundry
and stuff, and it was right next to where we were sleeping, and they�d take hairbrushes
and take that child into that room and hit her, her bare bottom, and she would cry and she
would cry. You know, I think�they had two young nuns who would do this to her. They
were told to do that; that was their job. They seemed quite oblivious that they shouldn�t
be doing this. And to this day, I wonder what happened to her, how she�finally, her
parents took her out of the convent. But they were cruel to her, and they threatened her
with not being allowed to go home; like they did with me, because they didn�t know what
else to do. The parents finally kept her home.

CP: But you ended up kind of just having to take part in the normal convent life. Do you
remember�can you tell me about your eighth birthday? Is that when you were baptized,
you said?

ED: Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Yeah. (laughs) Before�it wasn�t First Communion, the thing I had
to take, too. So I got some lessons, you know, so I knew a little bit about it, which I�ve
forgotten already. (laughs) But they arranged for that. I think it was around my birthday,
as a matter of fact. What was it, now? Yeah. My mother had invited her mother�my
grandmother, who lived in Vienna�to come for this party that she was going to throw. I
never heard of a party before, for anything. And that little house she was living in, it was
very nice: it had a verandah outside. She invited�I don�t know, all kinds of people I
didn�t know, never seen before or since. There were some young children there, too. They
figured I�m young and it�s my party really, so they have to have a few children. And they
put us outside on the verandah: the other party was in the house, and they were drinking
wine and having a good time. My grandma would occasionally come out to where we
were, the children. I didn�t know any of these children. She would bring us some goodies
to have, too. And I said I didn�t know what went on, because I didn�t know who they
were or what they were doing. So the only time I ever saw my grandma come away from
her house�I only saw her maybe four times in my whole life. I loved her; she was a very
sweet woman.

But anyway, before that was, of course, the thing to go to church and do all this stuff.
Before the whole setup began, suddenly somebody said, �Oh, she�s Leopoldine and Alice
and all these names.� They�re saying, �We can�t do it�she doesn�t have a holy name. We
have to have a name for her of an angel or something.� So they started saying, �What
name would you like?� I don�t know. They started saying all kinds of saints�Saint Soand-
So and Saint So-and-So. I just said to myself, �Mama, where are you?� She wasn�t
even there for that for me. So, one of the nuns happened to say, �How about Elisabeth?� I
said, �That�ll do. That�s it.� That�s how I got Elisabeth.

CP: Wow. That�s amazing.


ED: Yeah.

CP: We just have a couple more minutes left on this tape, but I just want you to talk about
�you said there�s�you have one nice thing that happened to you while you were there. I
guess you were musically talented when you were young?

ED: Yeah.

CP: Can you tell us that, really quickly? Can you tell us that story?

ED: Yeah. Yes, that was after I�d been there a little while. I�d got used to the eating and
all these other things. I had a very good memory, and I had a very good ear, too�which I
don�t have neither one now. (both laugh) But I had it. We had to go for a little Mass every
day before we go to school, you know, in another building on the premises. So somehow,
one of the nuns, who used to play a little organ that they had in the chapel, she realized
that I could sing very quickly and remember songs. So it became a habit with her to,
while the nuns and everybody were coming in to seat themselves to these events in the
morning; she could very quietly play the melody of the next thing they were going to
have in the chapel. And I could sing it. They didn�t know; they were busy seating
themselves and the children, whatever. The only one that was playing the little organ and
I were busy getting this song ready, and I could sing it. I had a nice voice (laughs) for a
little kid. It was nothing to me, and I was just natural because I�d always heard music at
home and everything. It was all very nice for me. And then they started to realize, and
they started calling me Lilly in the convent. So they said, �Yeah, she can do that. She
doesn�t practice for hours before or anything.� And so they were kind of glad to see that.
So somehow, they said, �Well, she�s our��they gave me a name.

CP: You said they called you the Little Nightingale.

ED: I was Nightingale, Little Nightingale.

CP: Well, I think that�s a good place to stop this tape, and we�ll pick it up with the rest of
it on tape three.

ED: Don�t ask me to sing for you. (laughs)


CP: All right. Thank you.

Part 2 ends; part 3 begins.

CP: Okay, this is tape three of our interview with Elisabeth Dixon, and is there anything
else that you�d like to tell us about your time that you spent in the convent when you
were young?

ED: Yes, I think I would, a number of things: some not as interesting, maybe, as others.
But it happened after I was there and I knew my mother had left and so on, or was about
to leave. I suddenly realized that I was all alone, and that�s not a good feeling when
you�re about eight or nine years old. So, what had to be had to be. I had no choice. Let�s
see. First�that was my first experience of homesickness. I had lots of practice, you
know, as a little one from here to there, but this was�I was older, and I just missed
everybody from the family, because there was no way I was going to see them, I thought,
not for a long time. And that was�for that, I don�t think I had any friends or anything in
the same position. They all were moving around and going home and coming back, and I
never was. So the weekends, very often I was there alone, and everybody else�just
thinking about them, wondering when they�re coming back, the other kids in the school.
It was not a very happy time.

Let�s see. (shuffles papers) Okay. My mother was packing to get on her trip; she just
decided that was it. The girls, we saw a youngish nun, and she was very pretty, and that�s
unusual, to see that in a nun. And she seemed to be, under all her costume and everything,
slender and little�like a young little girl, actually. She was�she took over from another
nun, and their job had been�the older nun had been, and she will do now, to bring our
food to our building and then share it out and see that everybody has something to eat. So
she was there alone. The way it was set up, there was quite a large�it really wasn�t,
because when I went back again, nothing was large in the convent. To me, it seemed it
was quite large, for the tables for the girls to eat�to eat from, I should say. Yeah, I don�t
quite�this is confusing. And we liked her; she was so sweet.

But this room, our dining room sort of thing, had a double door at one end. The food was
brought by probably another nun from the kitchen, which was in another building, and I
think they rolled it somehow, in big�I don�t know what. I don�t know, like buckets
almost. And we had to take turns, you know, to go up with the plate, and she would give
us something and we would go and sit down again. We had her, and we were so glad to
see her because she was so different. Nuns get sort of a pallid look after a while,
especially as they get older, and they don�t look too happy, really. But she was still sort of


love and happiness, I think. She even had a cross on her�they all do that, on their belt
thing. So she would walk so quickly, compared to the older nuns that she would sort of
hit the thing that was holding the cross, and it would bounce on her. (laughs) We just
enjoyed looking at her.

Well, that went on for a little while, and then we suddenly noticed�you know kids, they
find things out. After she would have given us our first helping of everything and we
were settling and eating, she would disappear. She would go behind one of the open
doors, and then come back again. You know, these nuns have big sleeves, and they
always put their arms into the open sleeves; they are supposed to pray all the time. And
then if anyone wanted more, they could ask for more and she would take her hands out of
her sleeves and give them more and so on. But we couldn�t figure out why she walks
away after we have our�after she feeds us at first. We couldn�t figure what happened.

But then we noticed that her habit wasn�t fitting the way that we were used to. The habit
is the gowns that they wear. We just�you know, sometimes little girls imagine things,
but we didn�t imagine this. We noticed the difference, especially because her cross wasn�t
jumping around as much, and she wasn�t moving quite as much, and she kept
disappearing still behind the door. Sometimes we think we saw that she was actually
chewing. And then we realized that she�s going behind the door because she�s hungry, so
she thought, �Well, there�s so much food here for the kids; they�ll never miss that.�

We figured out between us that she goes behind the door and does this with her hand and
then puts that in the sleeve, and then when nobody was looking she�d eat it. Nuns are not
allowed to do that. They only are allowed, at least in this particular set of nuns�she
would only be allowed to eat in her building at a set time. They had their own dining
room and everything. But I guess we thought that maybe she had not pleased somebody
or something and they were punishing her, not giving her enough time to eat in her own
kitchen. Well, the cross stopped getting kicked around, and she was just not the same
thing. And that went on for quite a while, and then she disappeared and they exchanged
her with another nun and we didn�t see her for a little while.

Then one night, not too long after, I woke up in the middle of the night�and I woke up
one or two of the other girls, I think, or they woke up anyway as well. We heard a lot of
crying and moaning in the middle of the night, when you hear this when you�re a
youngster like that, and we were just shocked. We couldn�t imagine who would be crying
in the middle of the night. And then eventually, when all of a sudden the crying and so on
stopped, then we heard what sounded like a baby crying. We figured she had a baby, and
we didn�t see her for quite a while.


Then in the chapel�she came back a few weeks later and we recognized her, but she
didn�t look like she ever did. She was getting that pallor of the other nuns, and she was
not so happy. She was really very sad looking. We never�I never found out just what
happened to her, but there was always talk that if a nun had a child when she shouldn�t
have, they do away with them, because you�re not married to Christ anymore if you do
that, so you�re out of the Church. That was the way they looked at it. So, we were very
sad about that.

But many years�I went again�I have to go forward for just a minute. I would say
maybe fifteen years ago I went back, and that time I made sure that we were in the
nurse�s�in the nuns� house. I asked while we were waiting to have someone come and
speak, or let me speak to them. I asked one of the nuns, �What happened to the older
nuns when we were there?� They said, �Well, there�s only one left that I can think of, but
she is getting on pretty much in years, and she hardly ever leaves the house anymore and
so on.� I said, �Well, I�d like to see her and talk to her.� She said, �Well, I�ll see if she�s
having dinner, and if you can leave and come talk to you.� So she did, and we went to a
little private room and we spoke and we talked about the old times and so on. That�s
when I found out how they fared during the Hitler time. I�ll tell you that again later.

So at the end of our talk�she was very friendly. She had no teeth and she was very thin,
but I could still see�the eyes, I recognized. I talked about what she had to do while they
were not free. I was surprised, really, to see anyone left in the convent from my time. And
I finally said to her, �Do you remember at all when you used to feed�bring the food over
to us?� I didn�t say any more than that. And she got very quiet, and she said, �I think you
must be making a mistake. I never had anything to do with the girls who were living here
then.� Now, I know and she knows that that�s not true. So, you know, there are things that
happened in the best of homes. It was sad. But that was just very recently, this story.

CP: So do you think she just�it was too difficult for her to recall that and talk?

ED: Yes. She didn�t want to remember it. She was very old by this time. Well, old for a
nun. I felt sorry for her. She was so pretty.

CP: And we�ll talk a little bit more about this at the end of our interview. But for you to
talk about these memories�some of them sound pretty difficult to talk about. Is it hard
for you to talk about them today? Or, because you�ve thought about it and written about
it, it�s a little bit easier? What�s that experience like?


ED: No, it�s not�I haven�t written anything. I haven�t added anything to the (inaudible)
book for three years, ever since my brother died, because�you�ll begin to understand
why later on, too. I mean, I live with this all the time, in one way or another. The only
way I think I can handle it is to see the fun side, if I can. It doesn�t get easier.

You see, when I was writing�of course, Hans was the writer. If I needed a certain
expression or something, I�d pick up the phone and say, �Hans, what should I say? Is this
better than that?� and he�d tell me. I miss that. And he would send me articles that he had
written and say, �Now this one, only tell me if it is good.� So we kind of encouraged each
other, because it was his career, so he didn�t need much encouraging. But I did, and he
realized it. It�s a terrible thing. I could discuss anything with him, and did, all that we
were able to talk about together. Some of it we couldn�t, because we didn�t know how to
express it in English, and it was something that we�d never heard in German. So, we were
both deaf and dumb in some places. But I miss him very much.

CP: And even back in that time, when you were young and still in the convent, he was
one of the only people that would come and visit you. Is that right?

ED: Yes, he did come a few times, and he even brought Karl one time�his cousin, you
know. And I remember�now I�ll tell you that little incident. He picked me up from the
convent; he had to get permission to take me out for a couple of hours or something, and
they said, �Oh, sure, and then bring her back.� The three of us walked down away from
the convent, and they thought they were doing me a great favor, because they knew that I
loved ice cream. (laughs) So they walked down the street with me, and they said,
�There�s an ice cream shop down there. I�m sure you�re going to love it,� �cause I didn�t
like walking too much, (laughs) even then. But they said, �It�s worth it.� There was no
bus or anything like that. There was a tramway, but that was for longer rides, not just a
block or two down.

We got to the door of the ice cream shop, and they went ahead of me. Hans said, �Well,
come on, Lilly, choose what you want, what kind of ice cream.� They didn�t have many
choices then. �Come on and see what you want.� And I could not get up that step and go
into that shop. I don�t know why, and they didn�t know why. They said, �Come on! Come
on in,� and I said, �I can�t. I�m not coming, I can�t.� And only when I grew up and
thought about it, I�ve been wondering what had happened. All of a sudden, I realized that
was the shop that I vaguely remember when my mother kidnapped me from my father
when I was real small. It was really�I never knew exactly what happened, I told you, at
the end. But I had such a clear vision it would happen again, and I was older and I could
then understand. I told him that �I finally found out why I couldn�t go in with you.� What
it ended was the two boys brought me ice cream outside that I could eat. But I could not
move back into that store. Weird, isn�t it?


CP: It�s pretty amazing.

ED: Yeah. But I was glad that I finally realized what had happened. It�s just too bad a
memory. It just doesn�t work anymore.

CP: Well, it seems to work pretty well, at least as I can see it. (ED laughs) So, what
happened? How did you get out of the convent? What happened before you left?

ED: Well, the convent was getting smaller and smaller, more and more people. This is
now�see, when the Anschluss happened, the nuns had known, or they had been told by
their higher-ups, to start growing their hair, because under the thing they have on their
heads, they shave. You�re not supposed to have the beauty of hair or anything when
you�re that kind of a nun. But they were allowed, and they were told to let their hair
grow, because they said, �We may at any time have to run away. You may not be able to
stay to be nuns, to be looked at like that.� Of course, us kids, we noticed that occasionally
we could see hair under their veil things, you know.

All of a sudden�I mean, I had no idea what Anschluss meant, or what Jews meant, or
what anything meant. But I started to learn, because they finally explained to us a little
bit. The Anschluss is that now we�re not Austria; we�re part of Germany, because Hitler
just decided�he was an Austrian, you know. (laughs) Nasty man. We belonged to him,
because we speak German, you know, and all that, so why not? And they started an
invasion: that was what it was, but there was nothing fought because of all of that
propaganda that was coming forth when they suddenly showed us all their flags and
armbands and �Heil Hitler.� No more �Good morning�; it�s all �Heil Hitler.� No �Good
night�; it�s �Heil Hitler.� And all these uniformed people walking around, and there were
too many�well, I want to finish the first thought.

Now, where was I? Oh, the nuns one day, not too long after that, took us outside, the few
of us that were still there in the convent. She said, �If you look out in the sky, you�ll see
airplanes,� which we, I don�t think, had ever seen in that area anyway. She said, �Well,
look up. That�s because Hitler says that we belong to them now.� So, that was the way I
was told the Anschluss had started. But they were all welcomed by all these stupid
people. (laughs) They didn�t understand, or didn�t want to understand, what was going to
follow after that. See, he had an easy time with Austria, because they were still poor from
prior collapses of everything, and there were no jobs and he promised them all that. And
of course, he said, �I�ll give you enough to do so you have enough to live on and then
some more��all his propaganda, all his people around him that are yelling all these good


things. And you know, when you�ve had nothing for a long time, you say, �Heck, it�d be
nice to work again and have a little house or something.� And that�s how he won them
over, I think, without a shot being fired.

CP: And so at this time, the convent is shrinking. People are leaving left and right.

ED: Yes, yes. And then there came the day when I was just there. I didn�t know; nobody
talked about anything to me. If I asked anything, they just said, �Well, you�re here. We�re
here with you; don�t worry. Papa will come and Mama will come.� Well, one day, a nun
called up in the room that I was in, and she said, �Come down, come down to the
courtyard. Your mama is here.� Well, that was the first time almost in two years that I had
heard that. So she said, �Hurry up. She�s there, she�s in a hurry. Go and see her.� And she
said, �I think your brother�s here, too.� Well, I wanted to see Hans more than her.
(laughs) I ran down, and that�s when this thing comes about with the packaging. I didn�t
have anything.

But so she approached me, you know�like, if I saw someone, or now that I�ve had four
children of my own (laughs)�it�s unbelievable that after she hadn�t seen me all this time,
that she wouldn�t run to me and kiss me or something. She didn�t, she just was so busy
with herself. I think she didn�t know what to do, really. But she just came, and I guess
maybe she gave me a kiss on the cheek or something, I don�t know. And Hans sort of
lingered back a bit, I guess to give her the room to talk to me or something, or hug me or
something. Well, I didn�t work that way, but he didn�t want to get into an argument either.
He didn�t know what was going to develop.

And she just said to me, �Go and pack your things, because you and Hans are going on a
gro�e�what is it called? Gro�e�well, it meant a big journey. �The two of you.� Like,
I�d never been further than you could see, and all of a sudden I�m gonna go on a big trip
somewhere? So she said, �Now, you hurry up,� and she gave me a little suitcase that was
made of paper. You know, not leather or anything like that.

CP: Like cardboard, right?

ED: Cardboard, yeah, just a small thing. She said, �Come on now, hurry up.� That�s when
I said, when I was writing about it, I didn�t have the heart to tell her I didn�t even have
anything to put in it, �cause what I had, I was wearing. (laughs) That�s where I was.
That�s when we left, and we�it�s a little bit hazy. I don�t know when they exactly came
to get me, you know. I don�t think they took me that day, but pretty soon I was gone, and


she took me to�where did she take me? She took me to her mother�s house, my
grandma, and in the meantime must have told them what was happening, about leaving.

CP: Where was her mother�s house at the time?

ED: In Vienna. They always lived in Vienna, in an apartment building somewhere.

CP: And your father was away, but he knew that things were getting bad and he knew that
he needed to find a place, at least for his kids. Is that right?

ED: That is right. But he had been fighting and standing in rows from morning till night,
getting in all kind of weather and everything. There were lines all over this road or
whatever; there was no room in any indoors. Just all over these people, and they were all
hoping to get their children on a list that they could export them somewhere.

CP: So he wanted to get you on the Kindertransport list.

ED: Oh, yes. He worked his bones waiting and lining up and getting cold and getting wet
and all that. He just did it all the time, till finally our names came up. But nowhere did it
say that we would be together, Hans and I.

CP: You and your brother.

ED: Yeah. But it was so bad that no matter what it was, if we can go separate or
something, �I�m gonna send you.� And at that point, I�d like to tell you what I think now,
and I wrote not long ago. I was thinking about that, and I said that my oldest son,
Michael, has two children. One of these years that I�m talking about now, his children
were the same age difference and the same ages as my brother and I were in my time, and
it struck me. �Really, I have to tell something to Michael here.� And I asked him. I said,
�Would you���cause I was talking to him about these sort of things; he always liked to
hear about it. I said, �What would you do? You have two children which you adore.
Could you ever just pack them up and tell them, �I don�t know when I�ll see you, but it
won�t be long,� and send them away to a place you don�t know, people you don�t know,
languages you don�t know? And all of a sudden, you�re in this train and you�re going to
this place. Could you do that?�


CP: It�s hard to even imagine it. It�s really outside.

ED: That�s what he said, exactly. He held my hands very tight, and he said, �I could never
do that mom.� And I said, �Well, even if you thought there was a terrible alternative?� He
said, �I don�t think I could.� So, I�ve always remembered that. But the thing is, I think it
was the fact that our father cared so much for us. He just knew that�s the only thing he
can do; otherwise, we�ll just get killed, because that�s how it was going on. And my
mother wasn�t at it, but I heard later from Michael�from Hans�that she came down
from Germany when she heard that he was�I think he had to get a signature from her or
something that she would allow that to happen. She came to Vienna to talk to him and
say, �What are you dreaming of, to send the children away?� All of a sudden, she was a
good mother, you know. And he said yes, and she made such a fight about that. She said,
�England or the places? No, that�s too far. I have relatives or friends in Holland, and I
have friends in France,� I think she said, too. �They�ll take care of them.� But she hadn�t
done anything about it prior to this. She just heard. And my father said, �No, they�re
going to England.� And finally, after a lot of to-do, she must have signed or something.
But we went.

CP: You have a very powerful memory of that train station when you left.

ED: Oh, yes.

CP: Can you tell us about that?

ED: Yeah.

CP: Can you describe that for us?

ED: Well, I hadn�t ever been on a big train, I don�t think, before that. But it was evening,
I think, when my dad�only my dad took us to the station. My mother had gone back to
Germany. And the station was fairly filled with many�obviously parents, with their
children. There was so much talking, you know, between them, and tension, and the smell
of the smoke from the engine. It was kind of warming up or something already; there was
much more time. And then as the time grew a little shorter, I actually think I saw
somebody, a woman. She could not�when her child was about to get on the train, she
couldn�t let her go. She got her through the window, and she said, �I can�t let you go.�
My dad must have felt just as bad as she did, but he had the love to let us go.


CP: The wisdom to let you go, as well, to know that he needed to let you go. That was�

ED: That was in the evening, and the train�we were on the platform most of the time,
and then finally we realized that it was time for the train to go, and they started shouting.
�Get the kids on the train and say goodbye,� and that sort of thing. So then there was a lot
of crying and a lot of hugging, and some of the children didn�t want to go. It was just a
very sad thing. There were about, I would say, maybe close to fifty of us. I could be
mistaken by some, but it was quite a good crowd of kids. It was one of the last trains to
get refugees out of Vienna.

CP: And you up to that point lived with so much confusion and isolation. What did you
think was happening at that moment? Can you remember at all?

ED: All I cared was that Hans was with me. The train then�there was a whistle blown or
something, and we all had to be on board. He and I ran to the first window we saw, and
our father was out there. He found us, which we knew that he would. He was still saying,
�We�ll see you soon. It won�t be for too long, and we�ll see you again.� Then the last
thing�and then the train started to move, slowly at first, of course. So he walked along
with us on the platform, and as the train hurried more, he hurried more. He was running,
finally. And he said�he sort of called back to Hans and me. He said, �Gew�hrt Sie dem
Kleinen.� He meant, �Take care of the little one.� That was me. And then the train just
hurried out, and he was gone.

CP: And that was the last time that you saw your father?

ED: Mm-hm.

CP: And Hans must have taken that to heart, because he ended up taking care of you,
right?

ED: Yeah. And you know, that�s quite something, because he was only about fourteen
years old himself. And he was used to playing in the woods, you know, in the Vienna
Woods with his boy friends, go to the swimming pool in the summertime with the other
friends. He was a champion swimmer and all that stuff, didn�t have that much to do with
me. You know, typical teenager, with the nuisance sister. (laughs) It didn�t turn out that
way, at all.


CP: So you take this train to England. What happens? You get to England; you get on the
next station?

ED: No, we could only go as far as Holland. (laughs) We could have but (inaudible). No.

CP: Oh, then you had to take a boat ride. Is that right?

ED: Wait a minute.

CP: A train to a boat?

ED: In Holland�oh, I have to tell you first. That train started going, and I think it slowed
down somewhere down the line again. Somebody said, �These are the��there were the
Nazis on board, to examine the kids and make sure they�re supposed to be there, if
they�ve been signed in and everything; or if they�re carrying anything they shouldn�t be,
they�d steal it from them. You know, the parents might have given them some gold things
or something, and they wouldn�t get it anymore. It was really nasty, and I was petrified of
that. I had a little gold ring from my mother, with a little stone. It wasn�t a real stone, you
know; it was just the fact that she�d given it to me. And do you know what a muff is?

CP: (murmurs no)

ED: A muff is�

CP: Oh, okay.

ED: A hand warmer, you know. Well, I had a little hand muff. I said to Hans, �What�s
going on? What�s happening?� He said, �Well, I tell you what. You�d better not let them
see that ring, because they�ll take it away from you.� I said, �What do I do? What should
I do with it?� He said, �Well, I�ll make a little tear in the muff, inside. Put it in there, and
then look like you did nothing. (laughs) Because if he sees that, you�re not gonna keep
it.� And that�s what I did. That was the first thing that he really did for me, willingly. So
those huge men came on�they were so big compared to us; we were all kids. They
didn�t actually touch me or anything that I had on me, but I was sitting like�I didn�t
know if I looked guilty, or if they would look at me. I was scared. But they didn�t bother


us. They tried to look as though they were very fierce, and I don�t really think they were.
But they were Hitler�s people.

So that train then went as far as the Hook of Holland, and at the Hook of Holland, still in
the�wait a minute now. In Holland, the train stopped, of course, because it couldn�t go
any further. Let me see. Yes, they pulled up in another station. I think I must have dozed
off; it was evening already, and I was quite young, eight years�not even eight years old.
What was it now? It stopped, and some of the bigger boys that were with us as refugees
�we thought we�d better ask somebody why it�s stopping; we were afraid that we were
going to be examined again or something. And somebody yelled out, �No, we�re in
friendly Holland.� They said, �Look out the window.� So it was stopping, and we looked
out of the window and it was�the platform was crowded with women, Dutch women.
Each one had a big sack of something: it was food they were handing us.

CP: Wow.

ED: And there was milk in there. I don�t know, a little bit of fruit or something. What else
was in there that they gave us? Oh, sandwiches, of course, which wasn�t very well known
in those days. But they did it on white bread. I, for one, had never seen white bread in my
life, because the European bread is so good, and the best kind is not the white bread. I
said to Hans, �Look, Hans. They even gave us cake.� (both laugh) And Hans said, �You
silly thing, you. (both laugh) You have a lot to learn.�

CP: It must have been a disappointment when you realized it was just white bread. No?

ED: I thought it was heavenly.

CP: Okay, okay.

ED: I was hungry! I didn�t care what it was. And so then�I have a Dutch daughter-inlaw,
and I know her mom and everything. Whenever I used to tell Ellen about it, my
daughter-in-law, I would cry. I said, �It could have been your mother standing there.�
There were all ages of people handing us this food. �It was such a kindness that I can�t
tell you.� She�s a good kid that we have here. Where was I now? Oh, and when we had
pulled out of the station�no, before we pulled out of the station. We had a boat, quite an
old boat, waiting for us, to take us across the�what is that horrible crossing you have to
make for England?


CP: The Channel?

ED: The Channel. The Channel is a wild piece of water. (laughs) That�s what we had to
get over. There�s no other way to get there; they didn�t have a Chunnel yet or anything
like that. It also was dark and raining, and our sort of�the lady that looked after us, or
tried to look after us, made sure we were all lined up, you know, squished together, so we
would quickly go as one. Then she said, �Now, as long as we�re all quiet and we�re all
here and everything, now we go on a boat ride. She said, �Run, because it�s dark, and we
need to hurry up. It�s late. Let�s go.� So I remember looking at the floor�it was dark and
wet, because we�d been on the train, so it wasn�t like that. Well, that was what it was. She
just told us, �Get on it, get on it, get on it. Let�s get in,� just pushing us in, almost, to get
away from there, because there was still a chance that they could have made us turn
around. We were too close, still, to Germany.

So we did, and we were headed for London. I think it was to London, yeah. I wrote about
that once, too, and I said I was very tired, so the lady that received us in the boat, she
could see that I was really weary and I wanted to sleep. She thought I was just so
unhappy. Well, I wasn�t happy or unhappy. I was nothing; I just wanted to sleep. I was
cold. And she brought a blanket from somewhere, and she wrapped me in it, and she said,
�Now, you sleep here, and I�ll wake you up when you need to get up.� And the next time
I woke up was when we were in England.

CP: Well, I think that�s actually a perfect place to stop for this tape, and we�ll pick it up
when you wake up in England on the next tape.

ED: Okay.

Part 3 ends; part 4 begins.

CP: Okay, this is tape four of our interview with Elisabeth Dixon. And where we left off
is you�d fallen asleep on your boat trip over to England, and you wake up and all of a
sudden you�re there.

ED: That�s right. We landed, and lets see we had to get into a�where did we land? I
think we landed in London, and it was morning, close�it was quite a crossing, I guess. I
don�t know�I slept. Now, when we docked, we somehow had to get on a train again, and
there was another lady from the Society of Friends waiting. They helped us all along. She
said she wanted�she got out with us and said, �We�re in London now. We have your


parents waiting somewhere here, so you have to listen. Don�t be rowdy; just listen for
your name, because you won�t know who it is.� And I think I wrote that they gave us�
it�s an identification that we could hang over ourselves, so that the parents could
understand that this is their child, or the child they�re gonna look after for a while. But I
said, �This is not like the identity cards that they put on people that we had to leave
behind, have to wear all the time. We�re wearing this for a different reason. We�re free
now.� So that was that.

And then she said, �Now, the ones that are being picked up here, we�ll start with that. You
get out, and the ones that are not, you�ll make another trip with me.� So she looked after
us. On the platform, when we landed�it must have been in London. (laughs) Yes, it has
to be because, yes, she said somebody�s name, and two parents came and took one child
away. This all went very smoothly, and there�s always one child going, one child going,
and we were still there. We hadn�t heard our names, and we were getting more worried.
They�re taking one child; who�s gonna take two? You know what is this? So, there�s
nothing we could do about it, except just worry about it. Hans, I think, to just soothe me,
said, �You don�t know any English,� and I said, �I know I don�t.� (laughs) But he says, �I
want you to say some English words.� I said, �How? I don�t know any English.�

He said, �Well, you know, we�re here in London now. You can say London. There�s a
gentleman that�s been over there watching this.� I hadn�t noticed anybody, but he had,
and he was a very nicely dressed gentleman and he had an umbrella, because it�s always
raining in England. He had a hat on, a nice hat. And Hans said, �I want you to go to that
gentleman, and I want you to ask if he can tell you where we are.� I said, �I don�t know
how to say that.� He said, �Well, I�m telling you how to say it.� So he told me what to
say, and I went. I said, �Do I have to?� �Yes, you have to,� he said. I went over to him,
and I said in my way�I don�t know how it came out, but I said, �Please, sir, tell me�
would you tell me if this is�would you tell me if we�re here in London Town?� And the
gentleman looked at me, and he smiled a little bit and he said, �Yes, my dear, you�re in
London.� I always cry when I remember that. So, he was very nice.

CP: And eventually you and your brother�you said you were the last two, right?

ED: Well, yeah, just about the last two. We were still worried. Hey, they all left and we
didn�t. All of a sudden, a little old lady came down to the platform, and he said, �There�s
still somebody here.� It turned out to be our foster mother. She was a little sixty year old
lady who looked like she was about seventy-eight or something. (both laugh) I shouldn�t
say that. She was an elderly looking woman, for her age.

CP: And her name was Maud, is that right?


ED: What�s her first name? Oh, Maud Harker.

CP: Harker.

ED: Maud, M-a-u-d, Harker.

CP: H-a-r-k-e-r?

ED: K-e-r. And she didn�t�you know, she was as scared as we were, I think. I mean, she
took a chance. She was just an old lady. But she had a friend who had a car waiting for
us, because we�wait a minute. Where did they take us? I think somehow we landed in
Leeds. You must have heard of Leeds, in England. But we weren�t gonna live in Leeds;
she doesn�t live in Leeds, and it�s quite a way away from Halifax, which is where we
went. She spoke not a word of English; I couldn�t understand it, nothing, just like we
couldn�t understand her. But the lady who was there to sort of give us away, she said,
�Well, that�s your new mother, to take care of you.� But then she went off, and that was
it. So she took us in the car. She was talking a mile a minute in English. (both laugh) It�s
like you�re deaf and dumb all of a sudden, if you know nothing of what everybody is
saying. It�s a very weird feeling. But anyway, that was going to be our life, so something
had to be done. She took us in that car, and the friend was driving us then to Halifax, to
her house where she lived. Let�s see. Well, then we got out. We couldn�t even say thank
you, because we didn�t know how to do that. It was dark by the time we got there. She
took us into the house, and we realized very quickly that there was a young man there,
too, and an older man. The older man was her husband, and she had a son.

CP: Jack?

ED: Jack.

CP: And Ben was the husband?

ED: Ben was the husband. You know more than I do. (both laugh) Did I tell you that?

CP: I got it from you, yeah.


ED: Oh, thank you. So, yes.

CP: And you said Jack was about five years older than your brother?

ED: Yes, but they had the same birthdays. Weird. And we learned much later that it was
Jack who persuaded his parents to take the two children. They were told that we would be
two; we didn�t know that. So we were very relieved to be together, first of all, so there
were two of us who couldn�t speak anything. Hans knew an odd word from school or
something, but nothing that he could do a conversation in. And we quickly realized that
they had�Jack or somebody�it must have been Jack, because the woman was with us.
He must have prepared an extra special evening meal to welcome us, which was very
nice. The father�well, the reason the father couldn�t have done it was because it turned
out�well, I�ll tell you in a minute about that.

My brother has a thing that he cannot eat or do anything with fish, no matter what it is. It
seems when he was a little boy, he swallowed a bone or something, and he had such a
scare he just�all his life lasted this horror of fish. He just couldn�t. And of course the
English love fish, and they thought then�and I�m sure they do still�that it�s a very good
meal, you know. Besides, we were hungry again. So they had set the table in the kitchen,
but it was a set table and they all sat down and started eating with us. Well, Hans was
sitting this side of me, and I was sitting next to him, and of course we could just look at
each other every now and then. We couldn�t say anything even to each other.

But there was the moment when Hans was about to put his fork in his mouth, and I
quickly said, �Hans, that�s fish!� (laughs) He had to put it down. It was one of his most
embarrassing moments ever, because he couldn�t explain why, and I couldn�t, and we
knew that they were trying to be very kind. Oh, it was just a terrible thing. And they were
going to keep us for a while, you know. Oh, it was awful. (laughs) But eventually, he
hated it so much�the fish�that he managed enough words somehow, or just sign
language or something, to make them understand that he just can�t tolerate it or
something. So he said�he told me then that�well, I knew I was there, but they realized
there�s something wrong with the fish for this boy here, and he couldn�t explain what, but
they were good enough to never serve fish for him again, as long as we lived there. So,
that was sort of a happy ending.

But I was shown to my room in this house, and it was just a one-story house, on the long
side. My room was about as long as this table, and about�you know, about this wide.
Then came the wall, and there was one door in there, and I�m looking to hang up


something and I don�t see a closet or anything, but there was a hook on the back of the
door. That was going to be my hang-up place�not that I had any clothes, really, but I had
a coat and stuff, and then later on a uniform to go to school with and all that. So anyway,
that was my room. At one end there was a little cabinet with about two or three drawers
and that was it, and then at the foot of the bed there was a window leading to a garden out
there. Every now and then�well, I just fell asleep again, I was so worn out; just threw
myself on the bed and heard nothing till I was waking up. When I started waking up, I
kept hearing a bell go ding-dong, then nothing, then ding-dong. (laughs) It wasn�t a clock
or anything. I thought, �What the heck is this? What do they do here? Do they think it�s
Christmas or what?�

So finally, I got dressed, and I went out of my door. I didn�t know where else to go; I
didn�t know where Hans had gone. He had gone in the other bedroom with Jack. I was so
glad to see him, and he said he�d been looking around to see what there is here. I said,
�What is this bell that�s always ringing?� He started to laugh. He said, �It�s a doorbell.
They have a mom-and-pop type store, but it�s in front of their house, part of the house.�
So anytime anybody came and opened the door, the bell rang. Oh, I thought all kinds of
things! I was glad to hear that. Then, of course, we still couldn�t talk to the people. Jack
worked, so he had gone to town to work in the carpet shop in Halifax. There was no link
between us; we couldn�t say anything. This lasted quite a time.

Hans then finally said, �Look, from now��we had a few words already that we could
say, he more than me. But he said, �From now on, we�re not going to talk in German. No
matter what it is, you have to tell me in English. If you don�t, I won�t answer you. We�ve
got to get ready to talk to these people.� Well, of course, I could see the sense in that, but
it�s very difficult. (laughs) But that�s what we did, and from then, I don�t think I ever
spoke German again. And within about two months or so, I was ready to go to school,
�cause they couldn�t accept me till I could speak English. It was time for me to be in
school. And Hans, he could take evening classes, �cause his education was interrupted
with all that stuff in Austria.

So one of the first words I remember that I used to have to say�first of all, this lady,
Maud, we were told by Jack�through Hans. Hans told me we have to call her Auntie
Maud, and Uncle Ben, and Jack. That�s who they are. Oh, what was I telling you before?
Oh, the first words that I didn�t forget so easily in English was �apple,� �banana,� and
that turned out to be my choice of dinner. I could either have a banana or an apple for my
dinner, and that was the beginning of being a hungry little girl. The older people in the
end had trained me to run for them just about every night to a fish and chips shop; they
were big on fish and chips, and there happened to be one around the corner from where
they lived, not exactly there, but very close. It wasn�t rationed, either; it was one of those
things you could just buy, if you had the money. So they would send me to get them for
them. They would eat them, but I could choose my banana or apple.


I had experiences because in Halifax�it�s in a valley, this town, and it�s a mill town.
They used to make carpets and bedding and that sort of thing. It was a lot of good stuff
they made there, and that was their industry there, the main industry besides ordinary
shops like you would get in any town. Really, there was Halifax, and there were the two
tops, you know, on the buses�they had a double decker bus still, and even though they
would sometimes go on the lower road, very often we�d seen one right on the top, these
double deckers, in all weathers. They had terrible weather; they had snow and everything.
The double deckers were still going. (laughs) But we got used to it, little by little by little.
But that was the beginning of a very difficult ten years.

CP: And at first you only thought you were going to be there a short period of time.

ED: Yes.

CP: But you ended up staying there for ten years. How long did it take you to feel
adjusted�or again, did you always feel sort of left out or different?

ED: No, I didn�t feel left out. I felt different, because I don�t think the people around
where we lived�the whole town, I think�had ever seen two foreigners in their midst.
And Ben and Maud spread the word that �We have the two kids from Europe,� you know,
so the doorbell would go extra often because they all wanted to come and have a look at
us.

CP: Did you feel like an attraction or something?

ED: Yeah. (laughs) I hated it! And Hans�I just wrote that he made himself scarce. I
don�t know what I could do; I didn�t know where to go.

CP: So how did you feel towards Maud and Ben? Was there conflicted emotions? Did
you feel thankful that they had you there, or did you not like them?

ED: Well, in an adult sort of thought, which we had to be grown up in five minutes at that
moment and from then on. But we realized that, A, we have to be very grateful because
we knew what was happening in Europe; and B�what was the other thing? For taking us
in, and the other reason�we had no alternative. You see, the people from the Society of


Friends, even after we�d been there maybe a month or so, they sent people around to talk
to the children they�d left with people. They were very thoughtful, you know, because I
don�t know what they would do if the kids said, �No, they�re beating me,� or something.
Where would they go? So we heard that they were going around�I think they even
called ahead of time and said, �We�d like to speak to the refugees you have.�

So she came, I remember, and before she came, Hans said to me, �This is where they�re
gonna ask you questions.� We talked in German, that time. �We�d better just fib a bit, you
know.� We�re not as happy as we make out to the parents. In letters we had written how
wonderful it was and everything, and they were so happy and they had written happy
letters to them and all that. It wasn�t like that at all, but we didn�t want to worry our
parents, at least our father; I don�t know if we could write to my mother then or not, I
don�t know. But so we had to always watch what we said about them. Now, deep down, if
it hadn�t been for Jack and they said yes, we would have�I don�t know, we never would
have been there. So we have that to be grateful for. But the other things�it was not
friendly; it was not good at all. Ben was a voyeur type guy, and I had no idea what that
was, and so I couldn�t explain it to Hans and I couldn�t explain it to anybody, because I
didn�t know the words for it.

CP: You had the sense, you said, that he was kind of an evil man in that sense.

ED: Yes.

CP: You mentioned that there were�

ED: He liked to feel me and pick me up and make me kiss him goodnight when I didn�t
want to kiss him goodnight. He drilled a hole in the bathroom door, and I said to Hans,
�What�s with that?� Jack had told Hans, �Now, you know there�s a little hole there in the
bathroom door.� But he said, �My dad thought it best to do that, because his wife, Maud
�in case she falls or something and needs help, he should know it.� It was all malarkey,
because I�d never seen her trip or fall or anything. He was looking when I was taking a
bath or going to the toilet or whatever. It was his game, you know, that kind of stuff, and
he knew that I didn�t like him. That, I couldn�t hide. But he had no intention of changing
his habits, because he knew I couldn�t explain it to anybody, what he was doing.

CP: And you were pretty much trapped there�

ED: Yes!


CP: At least you weren�t in Europe being murdered.

ED: Yes, but still, we were alive and we were together. So those were our ten years
together like that.

CP: That�s still not an easy tradeoff, though. It still sounds very difficult.

ED: It is difficult, because the two people, the older people, they just didn�t know how to
be parents. They were just weird. They had two dogs, two cats, and two birds in the
house.

CP: That�s too many.

ED: It was a small house, really. Yeah, what was I going to tell you about them? Oh, and
they had one of the dogs was a beautiful Alsatian dog. Betty, they called her; they had
names for all these creatures. It�s a small house, and they had these six things there.
(laughs) Oh, gosh, what was I going to tell you about that? Oh, Maud, she was supposed
to keep the house, cleaning it and cooking and so on, housekeeper. Ben�s place was the
shop, and that�s how the work was separated. Jack had to said to her, we heard later, that
the reason they should not�they should take the two of us�is that �I�ll have a brother
that I�ve never had,� if the boy they will take, �and for the girl, she�ll be a good
companion to my mother and a helper.� Well, that means you�ve got to do all the cleaning
and dirty work. Ben, he heard probably a little young girl coming, and he was delighted.
He was smart enough to know that I wouldn�t be able to talk.

CP: Is this where Miss Scott comes into the picture? Can you tell�

ED: Oh, later. That�s later.

CP: That�s later, okay.

ED: When I got to high school. You want me to jump to that? I can do that.


CP: Is there anything else that you�d like to share about the early years?

ED: There�s a lot, because my life did change while I was with them, and it was my
doing, the change.

CP: How did it change?

ED: Well, I just did all I could, and we often�oh, Ben was always complaining about
me. Not to me: to Jack to tell Hans, and Hans had to tell me. This was endless. I tried
everything. I got older and I stayed away from him, and he knew it. That annoyed him, of
course. So everything I did�I was getting piano lessons free from somewhere, from a
lady, because Jack played piano very well and they had a piano in the living room. I had
to practice, of course. I had never played a piano. I chose piano when they asked me at
school, high school, what would I play�some jumping ahead there. But when I used to
practice, he used to walk through the room and stand there (laughs) and walk out again.
He just couldn�t stand it that I was practicing and doing something. How long do you
think I could stand that? I wiggled out of the lessons. I couldn�t do it. So that probably
satisfied him for the day: he ruined something else for me. Oh, I don�t know. He was just
an awful man. Where were we?

CP: Leading up to your high school years when things started to change, you started to
change.

ED: Oh. Well�oh, yeah, I was going to continue with Hans and me. Ben started saying
to Hans all the time, �She�s a troublemaker.� That�s all he would ever say about me.
Troublemaker! (laughs) I never got anybody in trouble, except he was afraid that I might
say something about him when I was older�and I didn�t. But except�you know,
everything I did, when I tried to help him in the shop and anything, �She�s a
troublemaker, that one,� he would say. I was that one, that person. It used to make me�I
don�t know, I cried a lot. And Hans, I couldn�t wait till he came home and I could talk to
him again. He knew how tough it was. But he used to say, �Let�s go for a walk,� and
we�d walk down. We had a street leading away from the store, and it was a lane type of a
place: very nice, woodsy. And we would talk it out. He wouldn�t turn around till we were
both laughing again. And it always came back to, �Now, look, if we weren�t here it could
be worse, because they could have separated us at any time.� So that was pretty bad, but
he got me through those things.

And then there was one time when Hans just got sick and tired of hearing him complain
about this troublemaker. I think he�d swallowed hearing that for a couple of years


already; I can�t be sure, but it seemed so. So Hans, who was always friendly with both of
them, as friendly as he could be�and he was never nominated as the troublemaker, you
know. (laughs) Just me, who was just a schoolgirl doing my homework and everything I
should be doing, I was a troublemaker. So Hans blew up, and he just started to yell at
Ben. (laughs) I heard him do that. He said, �I�m tired of what you always call my sister!
What�s she doing wrong? It�s not right to do that,� on and on and on. And I think Ben was
taken aback, because he�d never heard Hans like that.

That was the beginning of a little less ugliness about him�not that he ever liked me, but
he didn�t talk so much anymore. That suited me fine. If he never said another word, I�d
be happy. But he was just driving me crazy, and Hans�and he kept it in, too, like I had.
And after a while, he said, �No, I can�t have that happen.� So he saved me again. It was
like that. They didn�t care about us as people, and they were annoyed because I think,
stupidly, that somebody had started the rumor that we�d only be there for six months,
because then they�ll send us to Canada. I don�t know who started that, but everybody
seemed to believe that. After six months, we couldn�t go: the war was on then, and we
were there for almost ten years. Not me�I left them after, I think, eight years. That�s
where the other part begins of my life, when I left there. You wonder, �What�d she do
now?�

CP: Yeah.

ED: I need to tell you.

CP: Yeah. Did Miss Scott come before that?

ED: No.

CP: Okay. What happened next?

ED: Well, I had diphtheria when I was about�the first year in high school. I don�t know
how old I was. Eleven, I think. I was so ill I was�I missed a lot in school. I was still
learning English on the way and everything. When I came out of there�I was in a
hospital for, I think, about two months, �cause Maud had no idea�or if she had, she
didn�t practice it�of helping me recuperate.


This is where Miss Scott comes in. She and the school doctor�there used to be a doctor
for each school in those days, not to examine but to talk to the girls�it was an all-girls
school I went to then�and answer questions and things like that. How am I telling this?
The doctor�oh, she and Miss Scott decided to try and interest me in repeating the year,
because I was so far behind and still not perfect in anything. They thought that would be
better for me. She called me to her office and told me, and she was very kind about it and
everything. She knew I wouldn�t like it. (laughs) She said, �You know, it�s for your own
good. You won�t be sorry. You really need to have time to get better and all this stuff.� Of
course, again, I had no choice. I had to do it.

That year�when the year started again and I saw who was in the class, there was a girl
there called Pat North, and we became close, like sisters. There was a time when I was
living in their house�not right away, I was still at the Harkers�. Pat and I, we just were
funny and silly together. She was a beautiful girl, and her parents were a little bit off the
norm. Her mother liked to bleach her hair, and I never saw her without makeup. She had
a strange figure, so she had to make all her own clothes, this woman. She was very
clever: beautiful stuff she made. Anyway, she eventually�I�ll just skip all that, the big
thing, but agreed to�no, she wanted to�I used to visit Pat a lot, and we played together
and we went to school together and we made fun of the teachers together and all kinds of
stuff. (laughs) Oh, I�m losing myself.

I think she persuaded her folks that they would let me move into their house, and that is
because Miss Scott talked to them. The thing was that Em�that was Pat�s mother�once
came to the Harkers�. She�d heard a lot about them, �cause I was more at Pam�s than I
was at the Harkers� if I could help it�Pat, I should say. Not Pam, Pat. Pat would have
liked me to have been�she had a big bedroom and two beds and everything, and places
to put clothes that you don�t have. (laughs) Between them all, they decided it�d be nice if
I would live with them eventually, but that was a bit later, after the other thing.

CP: Is that why you said that Miss Scott saved your life?

ED: I think so, in the long run, because she�when I was sixteen�I had lost a year in
school. When I had a sixteenth birthday, I didn�t think�I thought, well, legally I can
work now; but I didn�t have the last school, the last year in school, and it was in that last
year that I should have matriculated and finished my high school education, and I didn�t.
I thought, �Hey, what�s it going to do to me? I want to be free. I want to do something
and live by myself.� Crazy. (laughs) And then Pat said, �Our neighbor, our back-door
neighbor, they�re looking for a maid.� They were a young couple�well, he wasn�t so
young, but she was young, the wife, and she was expecting her first child. He wanted to
pamper her and always had a helper in the house, live-in help. For some reason, he didn�t
have it at that time, and he wanted it desperately for her. The two must have talked about


me, so Pat said, �You know, Mom�s been talking to them. If you�re not going to go back
to school, go and be their maid.� I said, �Oh, good! I�ll have a job.�

Well, that was also a terrible experience, the whole thing, but that�s when Miss Scott
came to see me, when I was working for them. A principal never does that for anybody,
but she did. She had to first find out where I was, because Pat promised she wouldn�t tell
her, and she didn�t. So she had to find�she knew I had a brother, but she didn�t know
where he was. She found him somehow and talked to him, and she explained the
situation. She said, �You know, I really want her to come back to school and finish. Then
she can do what she wants,� �cause in that school nobody had ever left and gone to be a
housemaid anywhere. They all matriculated and they all went on to colleges and
everything, and I was going to be the first one (laughs) who worked.

But anyway, that was to my good. Out of kindness she talked to my brother, and he said, I
think, that he�d seen her. I said, �How could you see Miss Scott? She doesn�t know you.�
Well, one afternoon the doorbell rang and Miss Scott is standing on my doorstep at that
house where I was working. (laughs) I didn�t know what to say. She said, �How are you
doing?� She was very sweet. �You mind if I come in a little bit?� I couldn�t even think to
ask her to come in, �cause I had it as part of my deal with those people they�d given me
sort of another room that they said, �That could be your private room,� which I thought
was great for me, I�d never had that. So I had my little sitting room to ask guests in there,
if I had any.

She talked to me, and she explained to me that she really wished for me that I would
finish and all the reasons that there were. I knew the reasons. And she said�she
mentioned the Harkers, and I didn�t respond with anything from the Harkers to her. The
more we talked, the more she realized that�the more she knew what was going on
between me and the Harkers, and that I was very unhappy there. So she must have had
somebody who kept an eye on me all the years I knew her, or she knew me. I thought that
was really something. She arranged that I would go to the high school�it was a private
school. I�d have no fees; they would, I don�t know, give me grants that I don�t have to
repay or anything. I didn�t have anything to repay with. Even my uniforms�we wore
uniforms. Anything I needed, I could go and buy and not pay for them. The dinners�or
the lunches that they served at the school during the war, they were very good. That�s
where I got my real meals, not a banana or an apple. (laughs) I like both, but I mean, you
know!

CP: Well, that�s not dinner.

ED: That�s not. No, not really.


CP: Well, I think we have to stop for this tape, and we�ll pick it up on the next one.

ED: Okay. Are you all asleep yet?

Part 4 ends; part 5 begins.

CP: This is tape five with our interview with Elisabeth Dixon.

ED: (laughs) You�ve heard enough.

CP: (laughs) Never, never. But you were telling us about kind of the end of high school
and how you ended up going back to high school, and you were living with Pat�s family
at the time. Then what happened?

ED: Then another life just started with me. I was homeless for about three or four times
between that and being married. People would�I don�t know, I guess because I was a
foreigner. England didn�t like foreigners; they hadn�t seen foreigners in Halifax. There
was one woman who threw me out after we�d been doing fine, and another one�I was
sick. I�d had an operation in the hospital, and they�d kept me extra long because I�d told
them I had nowhere to go. They said, �We can let you stay an extra day or two,� or
something. So she came to visit me, the lady that I was staying with�or I was renting
from a room. She came to see me, and I thought, �She�s left it late, but at least she came
to see me.� She just came to see me to tell me not to come back. She had packed my
stuff. �I can�t have you back.� That was the next place I had nowhere to go.

Then I met one of my school friends, who was now a teacher; and I was teaching, but not
a trained teacher, but I had a teaching job. She said�I was telling her, �Everywhere I go,
they say it�s okay, then�

(audio interrupted)

On my seventeenth birthday, she called me in the front room. �I want to talk to you.� I
thought she was going to say, �Happy birthday.� She says, �You have to look for
somewhere else to live.� Just like that! What have I done? Nothing. That�s it. She won�t
even talk to me. I know what it is now: they were getting a stipend for me, and that stops


at a certain age. I didn�t know about that then, and she didn�t tell me. She was very nasty
about it.

CP: So how did you�how did you get by at that time; and also, when did you meet your
husband?

ED: Well, because my husband Ernie was Hans�s best friend at that time. He�d been away
for so long in the air force and everything. They just appealed to each other: they knew
about Europe and all that stuff. His mother�he went home to live at home when he was
discharged from the air force. The war was over, you know; it was time out. Whenever I
would be homeless, he would go to his mother and say, �You have so many friends,
Mom. Is there somebody that�s got an empty room that they�d like to rent out?� That got
me two of them, I think, and the third one I found myself but they threw me out too. She
was the one that came when I was sick in hospital and told me not to bother coming
home. That�s how it was. This friend of mine said, �Why haven�t you considered renting
an apartment? You�re always with somebody. You need to be on your own. You�d like to
be.� I�ll call you sometime and I�ll read it to you, how that happened. (laughs)

CP: There�s one other story that we didn�t get wrapped up, and that was back on the train
station when you were leaving and your father was waving goodbye to you. That was the
last time that you saw him, and then for that whole ten-year period, you were pretty much
out of communication. You didn�t know whether he was alive or dead. And then I guess
you said at some point, you heard from maybe the Red Cross that he was likely killed,
but you didn�t know for sure. Can you tell us how it was that you finally found out about
what happened to your father?

ED: Only from that piece of paper; and it was his daughter who found out something, and
she forwarded it to Hans and Hans, of course, sent it to me.

CP: How long ago was that?

ED: Excuse me, excuse me. (shuffles papers) I have 2005 here.

CP: It was 2005.

ED: Yeah.


CP: And at that time�we�ll show this document. But you found out that your father was
murdered in the Maly Trostinec camp in Minsk, Russia, and that�s M-a-l-y T-r-o-s-t-i-n-ec.


ED: Yeah.

CP: Was it�when you found out what happened to him, did you have a sense of relief?

ED: No.

CP: No.

ED: No, you can�t. We were never�we never really knew how to feel when first notice
came, because we didn�t know how or what happened to him. Why is he dead? How
good are they? But when we got that, we accepted that as a document from something
that she found on the computer.

CP: Was there any sense of at least now you know? �Cause it seems like one of the big
themes of your life is you never knew. When you were little, your mom never told you
what was going on.

ED: We�d sort of known, since the wrong information�well, the missing information.
We sort of thought he was gone, because otherwise we felt he would�ve�somebody
would�ve written. There wasn�t anybody to notify us. It just made all that last longer. It
will never go away; you can�t just turn it off and say, �Thank goodness he�s gone.� Again,
you have to say, �Well, I hope he didn�t suffer.� That�s all.

CP: And you said this a couple times, and I find it pretty profound. You live with these
memories; you live with this experience still to this very day.

ED: Oh, yeah.

CP: And how�do you feel like, then, that it�s shaped your whole life, being isolated
when you were young? Did that shape your life, do you think?


ED: Yes, absolutely. I was very uneducated with life. I had nobody to teach me anything
when I was growing ups. And it�s been the loneliness, you know, that always creeps in.
Other people have mothers or fathers to talk to them, but I never had that. I do know that
Hans, even though he had nothing to do with it, but he was her favorite child. But I had
him. I think I�ll never get over that, losing him. But I have to go on living. I just think that
Hans would not be happy if he knew I was unhappy.

CP: So still�
ED: And the same with my father. My mother, I don�t know. I don�t think she�ll care.
CP: So they�re still helping you to live, even today, I would say.
ED: I think so.
CP: Does it help you to have children and a partner that want�you know, want you to


tell these stories, and want to hear these stories? Does that help, to have a kind of


intergenerational connection?
ED: I think the children want to hear more. I don�t know�did you hear all the rest of
this? You knew about all this.


Pamela Bloor: Most of it, but not all the details. Much of it, but not all.
CP: Some new details.
ED: Hmm?
CP: Some new details. But just to know that they care and that they want to hear about it


�



ED: Oh, yes. The only thing I can say is that I have my reward, and my reward is my
children. I have listened to my whole family�I have two daughters and two sons.
They�re all very decent people, couldn�t get any better, and they all are married to very
decent fellows. I couldn�t get any better. I call them my sons; they�re really my sons-inlaw,
two of them. We have no divorces in our family. Everyone is happily married, which
is quite a difference from just being married. What else, Pamie?

PB: Your grandchildren.
ED: Well, no, just I want to go on with you first. That comes later.
CP: They all sound like they�re very successful and doing meaningful things.
ED: They are all doing well.
Edward Bloor: I�ll agree to that. I�ll attest to that. I really don�t think you can find�
ED: A better family.
EB: �too many other families that have four children who�there�ve been no divorces


and no criminal activity.
ED: Nobody smokes. Nobody does drinking more than they should.
EB: It�s just unusual, and amazing.
CP: So that�s your reward, is having a beautiful family.
ED: If I didn�t have them, I don�t think I could�I�d be useless.
CP: Well, I�



ED: But I do have grandchildren now, and I�m even a great-grandma, of the cutest baby
in the world. (both laugh)

CP: Well, congratulations. One of the things you said when we first spoke that really
touched me, and this has to do with family, is you said you learned everything that you
needed to learn about being a mother through your own mother�s failings. And like that�s
how you learned to be a mother. And just the way that you put that, I thought, was pretty
profound: out of having a distant mother.

ED: Well, I was looking for things. That�s why I can�t understand how she could have
been like that. I knew what that did to me, and I always tried to do the exact opposite to
my children. I may not have always succeeded, but I always tried, at least. (laughs)

CP: Can I ask you, how do you feel about your life today and about sharing this story
with the USF Library and the Florida Holocaust Museum, telling your story in this kind
of way? How does that feel to you, just today?

ED: It feels good. I felt I had to do it, and here came my chance. I�m still writing, so I
hope to finish that one of these days.

CP: But you felt compelled to share your story, even before this interview was set up.
You needed to share it.

ED: Yes, I was writing it. I�ve written it.

CP: Where does that come from for you? What compels you to write?

ED: I wanted the children to know. I did it for the children to know all the details. I
haven�t finished telling it.

CP: Well, what did we miss? That�s an impossible question.

ED: Just little things, nothing very important, really. The kids should know what sort of a
person I am and why I am this sort of a person. I sort of had that as the head thing, you
know, for when the book is finished. That�s why I�m writing it. And I went to the writing


group, and they start out �Do you want to write your life?� and all this, and I thought,
�Maybe I will.� I know very little about anything past my father, none of his family
except vaguely Tante Helene.

The rest of it�he came from seven children. Two or three of them went to France and
had a terrible time during the war, but they weren�t killed. There was only one of them
that died on the way to a camp. They caught him: he was their grandfather, I think, who
had the foresight to tell them all to go to France. Well, France was invaded, too. Nobody
thought that that would ever happen. So they were hidden for the time of the war and
doing the best they could. They had friends who tried to hide them. But the immediate
father-in-law was instrumental in shipping them out, get out of there, but not far enough,
in his case. We lost touch with those people. I never knew them myself.

But we know now�Hans and I said we�re the last Nichtenhausers in the world, because
wherever he would travel and look, he�d always look at every phone book for
Nichtenhausers. He didn�t have a computer, and I�m not computer enough to have the
sense to look on the computer. So that�s where someone in Paris had the idea�he came
across the name, and he�what is he? What is Hugo? Is that my cousin? He�s older than I
am; he�s about ninety-something. He has a son, who is very well educated, a teacher. You
might have met him; I think you�d like him. I haven�t met him, but I know him by
writing. I don�t know who started the writing, but we had a letter: yes, you are those
people, and then they started talking about different folks.

See, Hans knew more of my father�s family than I ever did, �cause five years is a big
difference. He�s grown and I�m still ten years old. He lived longer in Vienna, you know,
till I was born. A five year old can remember quite a bit. And most of that family lived in
Vienna and they were always together. They were a very closely knit family, which I
missed. I just wasn�t aware of it, �cause I was too young and I wasn�t even born for most
of it. So, that�s how it was. (laughs)

CP: Well, I just have one last question for you.

ED: Yes?

CP: And that is: with your life experience and with your story, do you have any kind of a
message for future generations that might watch this video, or for your family that might
in the future watch this video? Would you like to leave us with some sort of message?


ED: There�s a lot I�d like to say to them. The important thing, I think, in life is: be a kind
person, and be loving and lovable. If you�re standoffish, you�ll always be alone. If you
had the misfortunes I had, I was alone for most of my life. Pat was really my first feel of
how it might be if I had a relative, but then that ended poorly. It could, because we
weren�t related. But I told the kids, I think, that I�ve tried to not be like my mother all my
life. I have fought it. I know I look like her. But she was just so different, and she was
indifferent to me. To hear her talk and to see her, she was the world�s best mother in the
whole world, and she really wasn�t. And she was not an evil woman, but she just�she
came first, and then came Hans. (laughs) And all kinds of other things happened, and
maybe then came I down there. It�s not nice. She didn�t have a very good family. Her
father was a mess�he was a cold sort of a man�and her mother was a nice little woman,
very nice.

CP: Well, I think that�s a very good lesson to take away. Be kind, love, and be lovable. I
like that. Well, thank you very much for an amazing interview. I really appreciate it.

ED: I�m glad we met.

CP: Me, too.
