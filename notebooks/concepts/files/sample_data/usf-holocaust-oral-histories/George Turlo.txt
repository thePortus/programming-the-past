Tori Lockler: Today is November 30, 2010. Our interviewee�s name is George Turlo; 
name at birth, George Jerzy Turlo. My name, as the interviewer, is Tori Chambers
Lockler. We are in Palmetto, Florida, in the United States. The language of the interview
is English, and our videographers are Jane Duncan and Richard Schmidt.


Could you start by telling us your name?


George Turlo: Hello, my name is George Jerzy Turlo, and I was born in Wilno,
otherwise known as Vilna [Vilnius, Lithuania], in 1934, March 13. My mother�s name
was Olga; my father�s name was Michael. My background is really very unique, as far as
the family is concerned, because several nationalities or languages or religions, even,
were taking place in my education. And really, during my young years, I was educated
exclusively by my mother and by my father.


My father came from a peasant family from Latvia; my mother came from St. Petersburg,
Russia, where it was a big family. My great-uncle Oscar Schlumburger, who was French,
he immigrated to Poland in 19�in, excuse me, 1871 after defeat of France by German
Army [in the Franco-Prussian War]. He was very much disappointed that his homeland
Alsatia [Alsace] was taken by the Germans, and he decided to settle in eastern part of
Poland and, after, in St. Petersburg. He have about six daughters and one grandson. One
of the daughters, Maria Schlumburger, was my grandmother.


1



TL: So Oscar Schlumburger was your great-grandfather?

GT: Okay, yeah. This was the great-grandfather from the French side. And from my
Russian side, this was a general of the Russian Army, Viacheslav Vilovsky, whose son
Vladimir Vilovsky married my grandmother. Vladimir Vilovsky was a colonel, a
commander of Russian cavalry officer school in St. Petersburg. My mother survived the
revolution in St. Petersburg�her sister died there from hunger�and after, she
immigrated to Poland, to Bialystok, with her mother, who always we called Madame
Vilovska because she was very strict Victorian lady. My mother and my father, they met
in Wilno. They both were avid sportsmen. My mother was a champion swimmer. My
father was the president of academic/athletic club in University of Stefan Batory [Vilnius
University], from which he graduated with law degree. And after graduation, I was
conceived; he married my mother and I was conceived. My mother was Orthodox
Russian religion; my father was a Roman Catholic; my grandmother was Lutheran, and
frankly I would call her atheist. So in home we spoke several languages: French,
Russian, Polish, and German sometimes.

My father was nominated as a district judge by president of Poland and we settled in
Domachevo, what is small town on the River Bug. Domachevo was mostly populated by
Jewish population; about 80 percent of population was Jewish. And my father and my
mother, they have very well established relationship with lot of friends of Jewish decent
in Wilno, where my mother learned all the delicious cooking: kosher cooking, Jewish
cooking and so on, you know, what I love very much. And we were living happily in this
Domachevo. My father sometimes take me for a trip to Warsaw. I was driving there,
even a car in Warsaw Zoo: this was my good times. And he loves hunting, and so very
often, he was hunting there in Domachevo and kayaking with his friend, a Jewish doctor.
And very often my father and mother were inviting guests, like this Jewish doctor with
the family, to our house, and other people�my uncle Peter Turlo, who was a military
cavalry officer. That�s what I remember.

TL: Would you be willing, please, to�

GT: And the war of September 1 [1939] found me on the courtyard in Domachevo, where
they announced through the speaker that German planes attacked all Polish airports. And
we children, we have been dismissed from school to go home; parents rushed to get us.
This was big chaos and panic. What to do? My father, as a judge, according to the law
was to protect all the court matters, so he was not called to military even [though] he was
the officer. And somewhere around September 15 the Germans troops start to cross the
River Bug and we packed all our belongings, the most precious belongings and court
matters on the carriage�was horses-drawn carriage�and try to escape to the east.
Unfortunately, on September 17, Soviets attacked Poland from the back, from the east.

2



So my father decided no sense to escape more to the east, so we returned back to
Domachevo.

TL: Mr. Turlo�

GT: And around September�I would say twenty-seventh�my father have to give up his
court to Soviet authorities: there was a Soviet committee there. I have even in possession
protocol of his surrendering this court to Soviets. And after, shortly after, the NKVD,
what is precursor of KGB, came and arrest my father, took him to Brest-Litovsk, and for
whole months they tortured him, tortured him unbelievably that everybody�you know,
they doing by blackmail, they do something to the wife and children and they gave me
[sic] salt fish to eat first when he was hungry and after no drop of water for several
weeks. And he have to sit on the chair with special raised fronts, so this cut the blood
circulation in his legs. But he didn�t divulge anything; he didn�t say any words or names
of friends to help the NKVD.

Meantime, this friend, his friend Jewish doctor, he collected signatures from the Jewish
population in Domachevo, about 1,000 signatures, and he sent it to authorities in Brest-
Litovsk. The NKVD let my father out. He came like a ghost, he have to drop all his
clothes because it was full of lice and ask my mother to burn, and he said, �Tomorrow we
have to escape, because I was declared an enemy of the state and I cannot live closer to
100 kilometers to the border��border between Soviet Union and the new Germany,
border who had been established before the war already because [Joachim von]
Ribbentrop, who was the minister of Deutsches Reich, and [Vyacheslav] Molotov, who
was Foreign Minister of Russia, they make the pact of non-aggression�not only nonaggression
but also partition of Poland. So this was in agreement: when the Germans who
come to Bug River from another side, Soviets advance with tanks and take this part of
Poland.

So we packed overnight, and again we escaping in carriage away to our friend Ralski,
who was like a forester. And after�

TL: Before you go on to the escape, may I ask you first the town you lived in,
Domachevo, can you spell that for me?

GT: Town? Domachevo?

TL: Mm-hm.

3



GT: Domachevo, I don�t know how to spell. I can write for you.

TL: Okay, I�m just looking for�maybe if you could just write it, just so that I can get a
sense of�I�m trying to follow where we are in the borders and as the borders change.

GT: All these towns in eastern portion of Poland, majority of population was Jewish�
about 70, 80, 90 percent sometimes.

TL: And Domachevo?

GT: Yeah.

TL: And then my other question before you go on to the escape is, when you were in
school in Domachevo with the large population of Jewish families that you had there, do
you remember any specific events of anti-Semitism against the Jewish children of your
town?

GT: No.

TL: Okay.

GT: No, I don�t remember anything like this. Probably there was, because in my memoir
�in the memoirs of my father, who wrote in Austria in 1951 and published in some
Polish newsletter�I lost my thought. He�

TL: In his memoirs, he was talking about some amount of anti-Semitism in the town?

GT: The Jewish people loved my father, because, according to these memoirs, he�
several times he saved them from pogroms. This what was said; I never have seen any of
this action. But the Soviets, they manipulated Jewish population. They manipulated the
Byelorussian, Polish, anybody, Latvian, to make fight with each other, to hate each other.
This was one of the purpose of their policy, of the Soviet policy, to create this kind of
hate of each other that nobody was�stop trusting each other. Before, this was like one
family. We never distinguished who is Polish, who is Jewish; they all the same human
beings. Okay? But the Soviets did this stuff, and anyway, when I was�I don�t

4



remember any pogroms. But I remember this doctor. I don�t remember his name; I lost
in my memory his name.

Anyway, we escaping from the Soviets. The next day they came to arrest our family to
send to Siberia. Mostly people who have been sent in November and December, they
perished on the way up; they were throwing the bodies out from the railroad cars. So we
knew that this is our choice, between the dead or escape. So my father escaped on the
skis to city of Slonim. We was able, with the help of this Jewish doctor, to get a propiska
�I mean, this was a Russian (inaudible) permission to travel on the train. Nobody could
travel without permission of the committee of particular town. And we escaped to
Bialystok, to my grandmother. Over there was not safe, too, because some Byelorussian
who were police cooperated very well with�I�m mixing this stuff now.

TL: It�s okay. So you were saying that September 27 your dad�your father had to give
�surrender the court to the Soviets. And then the precursor to the KGB�so, what, the
organization prior to the KGB�took your father to prison.

GT: It was not KGB then.

TL: No.

GT: It was NKVD.

TL: Okay, NKVD. Okay.

GT: Okay.

TL: They took him to prison. It was about a month, you said, that they tortured him
before the Jewish doctor received the signatures that got him released, at which point he
decided that your family needed to escape. So you were telling us that you packed
overnight and you were escaping to your friends, to your parents� friends, which were the
Ralskis. Is that where we�re going, right?

GT: Yeah, to Bialystok.

TL: Okay, okay.

5



GT: By train. My mother forbid me to speak any Polish. She put around me a big
handkerchief and if somebody asked, �Eto moi. rebenok; on zubnoi. boli,� saying in
Russian that �He is my son; he has a pain in the tooth��teeth, you know.

So, we got safely to Bialystok. Yeah. I don�t know who, but anyway some nosy people
�I don�t know, Byelorussian police�were start to looking for us. Or the Russian police;
I don�t know, don�t remember. And my father wrote letter from Slonim in French to my
mother that we are going to meet him on the rail station on certain day and certain hour,
and we met him. He came dressed up in NKVD colonel uniform. He loaded us to
military train with other Russian officers. And my mother and my father spoke fluently
Russian between each other and everybody was saluting my father. And safely we got
close to Slonim, and just before semaphore, then my father told us to get out and we get
out. He removed his uniform, put carefully in the package, and he said, �Well, my Jewish
tailor will make the repairs to the uniform for the rightful owner.� (TL laughs) I don�t
know. My father was resourceful and he was so courageous person, that he was taking
any kind of risk.

Anyway, in Slonim, we, of course, live under different names; I don�t remember now
even what names. My father was working as a rabochii. trudovo triada, what means �the
third ranking laborer.� He was working in some kind of automobile workshop there. We
lived in one room with one bed and one chair, I remember. It was very difficult to climb
out from the bed to go to do regular things at night, pee or whatever, because the
outhouse was outside and it was no electricity, no running water. And you used to have
to take a spade with you, especially in winter, to cut the icicle who came out from this
hall to be able to do this. Anyway, we lived somewhat happy because we have been
together in one bedroom, in one bed with one chair. My father was working every day
except Sunday, and Sunday was our outing day when we were going out to the woods or
to the church, whatever.

And then came 1941, and this when the all hell broke loose. I was�my best friend was
killed by the shrapnels of the bomb, and his brain tissue and blood coved me. My father
after, when he found me, he thought I am dead. But I was deaf. I lost my hearing and I
still don�t have good hearing. Okay, this is from the time of the war. My father, because
his knowledge of the German, Russian, and Polish, he because translator in municipal
government, whatever it was then. We able to get apartment after former Russian officer,
and there was electricity there. This was a big deal. I was able to read my books, and I
was very heavy reader; sometimes I read three books a day. And I used to go with my
father fishing in the Shchara River, who was floating to Slonim. And one day when we
were coming back from the fishing trip�I beat my father. I caught more pikes, fish, than
my father, and I carrying proudly that I have beat him and he congratulate me. �Well, my
student became better than the teacher.� (TL laughs)

6



And we met on our way a character who was a vestryman in our church named
Moiszewski. The kids call him Moses because he has exactly like the feature, like this�
depicted in the Bible, so you know. And he say, �Pan�oh. Mr. Turlo, Mr. Turlo, do you
know the war?� And my father said, �What war?� �The Germans attacked the Soviet
Union.� It was June 1941. And my father asked me to give some of the fish to this Mr.
Moiszewski, what I reluctantly gave.

Next day already plane, German plane, especially Stuka bombers, dive bombers, and the
Messerschmitt: this is�the planes were attacking a railroad station. We living very close
to railroad station and the bombs were hitting railroad station, and transports of Russian
soldiers were rushing to the front: they trying also to bomb the bridge of the railroad.
And the house we are living got fire, and we have to rush out into the field with the rest
of our belongings, whatever we had. And after, the Russian soldiers were running
through the field, and there were massacres from Messerschmitt fire. Like I mentioned
before, these heavy bombs were falling, you know, killed my good friend next to me.

And after the fight was over I was recovered, but our place was first�(inaudible); this
mean root cellar�where I would stay for probably a couple weeks. I develop high fever.
I don�t remember exactly what was going on after, when I recover. I found that my father
got apartment after�back in the apartment after some Russian officer. It seems to me
that I am going in circles now.

TL: Nope.

GT: No, no?

TL: No, you�re doing fine. You just kind of went backwards a little and told us more
detail about the story, so you�re doing wonderfully. So now, once you were in this
apartment�so now we�re looking around after June of 1941. So after the bomb had hit
and you had been in this root cellar, you had this apartment that you were in, that was of
the Russian officer. So can you tell us from there what happened forward?

GT: Okay. Like I mentioned, my father got the job of a translator because the knowledge
of the languages. And working closely in the German office, really, because he knew
pretty well German, he captured certain information about the transports, what the
Germans were going to the Russian front, and he was convening this information to the
Polish underground. Sometimes he entertained some people who were coming from
Warsaw, some couriers between Warsaw and Wilno or whatever. Our house was a safe

7



house. Then, other activity that I notice, that he and our priest, Gerhowski, they were
initiating creation of false birth certificates and various certificates for Jewish people�I
mean, Christian certificates�so they are able to change their identity and able to survive.
I don�t know for how many people my father did, and Priest Gerhowski.

And we supposed to go fishing one�and this was the June already of 1942. And
suddenly Gestapo came at night and arrest my father. Majority of what�s happened to
him and how he survive in prison is from his memoirs, what I recovered after his death in
1981. So this is not exactly my observance, but this was his testimony, what was written
there. And when he was in prison on July 1, 1942, the Germans�I would say their�
there was action against the Jew, but mostly this was carried out by Latvian, Lithuanian
SS under command of the German officers, and Byelorussian police dressed in black.

The ghetto was in the middle of the town of Slonim, surrounded by the River Shchara
from both side. It was, I remember, a road going to ghetto, but it was all barbed wire and
so you cannot communicate with anybody there in ghetto. So they decided to liquidate
ghetto, and these noises of explosions and the fire wake me and my mother and we are
looking through the window on a big fire over the ghetto. It was like half of the town in
flames. I said, �Where are the fire trucks?� Nobody heard the fire trucks. The answer
came in the morning. My mother and I were looking through the windows, and here in
the front of our house, who was located only about two blocks from the prison, start
marching columns after columns of Jews bringing out from ghetto. Some of them have
been wounded, in blood, barely able to walk. These who followed had been bayoneted or
shot by the guard, and behind them there were like carrying carts, some people with
yellow Star of David. And everybody who died, they were loaded, loaded, and all this
moving. And the Germans screaming, �Schnell, Schnell! Nicht zur�ck sein. No looking
backwards. Further, further.�

And here came this picture what I never forget; every time when I see this in my mind I
have tears in my whole eyes. It was a woman carrying a small little baby and holding a
hand of a four year old boy. Boy have a bandage over his head full of blood, and he was
limping; he was, like, making this moving of this convoy slower. Then the guard in black
uniform�I assume that this was Byelorussian police because they cooperated very well
with German, because liquidation of the ghetto was done by Latvian SS troops and
Lithuanian SS troops. And this woman was walking slowly, and then guard in black
uniforms jump to her, grab the boy away from her and bayoneted him. The mother,
trying to rescue the son, he shot her right in the mouth; and after, when she fall down
with the baby, he took this baby, small little baby, lift up in the air, and he insert this on
the iron fence who was surrounding this mini park across our house. My mother took me
away from the windows and said, �This is the most horrible thing we�re witnessing, and
we should never forget this.�

8



Next days�this is from my relation, not from my father�these Jewish people who have
been brought to the prison, they have been searched there, whatever. In the beginning,
they was not even searched. They loaded them on the trucks. They told them to take all
the clothes off, so the people were laying down in the trucks half naked in underwear or
something, this was out underwear. How I know? I climbed on the roof with my friend
Frank, and we are watching, because watching from the windows was forbidden because
they will shoot anybody who was watching from the window. And we saw on the corner
of each truck was sitting the guard in black uniform, and the people laying flat half naked
on the platform of the truck. And these trucks were driving just in front of our house
from the prison, and they were going about two kilometers outside of the perimeter of the
town. Over there were digged [sic] graves already, massive graves, and all day you can
�I can heard (makes machine gun noise) machine guns, and after single pistol shots.
My mother forbid me to go on the street because of the safety, and I have to watch my
small little sister. And she was trying to go before the prison with other women to find
out if their husbands are alive, or maybe they accept some food for them.

Meantime, according now to the father memoirs, after this first days without any making
selection, after the Germans start to make selection. So they selected people who have
certain skills�like cobblers, tailors, dentist, pharmacist, doctors�to spare them for
whatever, and the rest were undressed on the yard. And my father was jumping to the
crated little window in his cell which he share with sixteen people; there only was
standing room. And he saw that these young people, especially young people�saw like
one kapo�twenty, sixteen, and twenty, eighteen, were all very nice and handsome they
were smiling each other, hugging each other, kissing each other. They knew that they
would be dead in next couple hours. And the doctor we knew returned down on the floor.
He was tell his fellow prisoners, �It�ll be great if we can die so heroically like these Jews
are dying.� I was very anxious. I have some Jewish friends who were in hiding and I
was trying to contact them, to find them.

Oh, I forgot to mention: During the first several months of the German occupation, the
Einsatz commanders, who were allocated to each army group, they consisted from
Waffen-SS, police, other different. And their role was to kill every Jew and every
political commissar, Russian commissar. And my father got an alarming letter through
Priest Gerhowski, because my father never disclosed his name and address to anybody,
that they are begging for help because probably they will be the next�because they
survived then also for a while because he was a doctor. So my father told them, whatever
the German mayor was there, that he can fetch him a very good Steinway piano, but he
need a big military cart and horses. And this was granted, and the German soldier came
over with his horses. And my father�my mother, I remember, was begging him that it is
enormous risk because helping the Jews�any help, especially hiding the Jew, was a
death penalty immediately by the Germans. So he�s risking all our family. But my father
said that he have a plan, and he always was very smart.

9



Anyway, he went to Domachevo, and because he was afraid that somebody recognize his
face, he came at just before curfew so nobody was on the street. And the family of this
doctor, they hide in the cellar. And he was banging, banging. Finally when he scream,
�This is Michael,� [they said] �Oh, Michael!� They came out from the cellar, terrified,
and grateful that Michael came to rescue them. And Michael gave them false certificate,
of marriage certificate and everything. They loaned two pianos: one piano for the
B�rgermeister, whatever, and one small piano was for me.

TL: Okay, and this�

GT: What intermission?

TL: In just a moment, we�ll take�we�ll switch over to the next tape. But before we do,
this incident where your dad went and got the Jewish family and picked up the pianos,
was that before or after his imprisonment? So is it before�

GT: This was before, before, before. I already mixed sequence.

TL: No, no, no, that�s fine. But now we have it again.

GT: Yeah.

TL: Because�so this happened and then he went to prison?

GT: Yeah.

TL: And then�okay. So then, what we�ll do is we�ll take a break and we�ll get started on
the next tape and we�ll pick up from now his imprisonment forward. Okay?

Part 1 ends; part 2 begins

TL: Okay, this is tape two. We are with George Jerzy Turlo. Mr. Turlo, you were telling
us about your father�s imprisonment, so if you would continue with your story?

10



GT: Yeah, okay. I was sitting anxiously in the home because my mother told me some
about�I was very worried about some of my Jewish friends with whom I get acquainted
before, and also about Priest Gerhowski. And I found and I heard that Priest Gerhowski
was arrested by Gestapo also. So I figure out that probably my father�s friend the doctor
who Priest Gerhowski arranged apartment and private practice in his parish also
disappeared. So I start to wandering on the street, and I encounter a scenario, scene. I
see a black uniform policeman, probably Byelorussian, convoying young Jewish boy, not
so much older than me. And he was carrying on the top of his head jar of something
liquid�might have been the pee, you know; this probably was honey. And I figured, oh,
they probably captured him in the cellar somewhere, because a lot of Jews were still
hiding, you know, before they escape to the partisan, to the woods.

And I was so defiant, so defiant against any black uniform. I was just trying to do
something. So I said, �Well, I am going to trick this black policeman.� And when they
were passing me I wink to this Jewish boy and [with] another eye indicate fence. White
fence was running, and behind them was a garden, an apple garden or something like this.
And when I passed him I fall down and start to scream, �Oh, my leg! Oh, my leg! Oh, my
leg!� And policeman, distracted by my screaming, turn his head, and meantime this
Jewish boy took this honey and hit him over the head with the honey. But this guy was
cool. The Jewish boy jumped over the fence and start to run, zigzagging through the
garden. This policeman wipe his honey from the face, kneel down, put the rifle between
the fence, and start to shoot. Well, third, maybe fourth bullet hit him, the Jewish boy, and
he fall down. And this policeman climbed the fence to fetch him, and I was paralyzed,
seeing this stuff, didn�t move.

Finally, when I decided to move, I went to move and, suddenly, hand on my shoulders.
�Bleiben sie hier. You stay here.� And I look, and here is SS man officer. I didn�t notice
him; he was across the street, probably. �Herr officer, Ich will nach Hause gehen. Meine
Mutter�I want to go home, my mother�� [The officer said] �Nein, you�re bleib-ing
here. You�re staying here.� And after, when this black policeman brought this Jewish
boy to the gate of the prison, he was holding his stomach: his intestines were coming out.
He brought me under the gun also, this policeman, and he start to swagger�I mean,
talking quickly in the German to another guard there, pointing at me. And I was saying,
�Ich bin nicht schuldig. Ich bin nicht schuldig. I�m not Jewish; I am Polish. I�m not
guilty, I�m not guilty.�

�Nein, you be schuldig. You help the Jew. You are not Jewish? Take your pants out.�
So, I drop my pants. �Ha ha ha, you really are not Jewish. Get on this truck.� And they
throw me on this truck together with the Jewish boy. There were already some people
laying there; this was already end of the day, so probably this was the last transport for
execution. And I was mad at myself that I was allowed to be caught. I was worried
about my mother, what�how she will be crying. And what I can do? You cannot move.
You have to lay down. I remember how other people were laying down. They

11



sometimes throwing some jewelry, some watches with messages: somebody may find and
somebody know what�s happened to them, or whatever. I have nothing to throw. And I
felt�well, I have about twenty minutes to live, I would say. That�s how long it will take
to drive up.

And the truck start to drive. And I�m laying and I see some kind of blue head, like a
monster, blond and blue, beaten up to pulp. I couldn�t recognize who this person is. And
suddenly, this head start to talk to me. �It�s me, it�s me. Jerzy, it�s your priest.� And this
was Priest Gerhowski, this who was helping to save so many Jews. And he reached me
with a hand and touch me, and said, �Pray with me. Shepherd��whatever. �If it�s fate
that you lose your life, this is the fate, but maybe God grant you life. So I pray with you
that you survive this.�

And they brought us�it�s already red, sunset, I remember. All the graves have been
covered already with sand, whatever, except they left the corner portion for the last
transport. The trucks with machine guns and two SS man laying there behind machine
guns; an officer with pistol, whatever, in commanding, and also very old commando with
spades to bury after the last victims of the day. And they put us kneeling on the edge of
the grave together: was this boy, and I saw two little girls, some Polish family, two man
and wife, and after another Jewish people and this. And the officer said, �Fire!� Opened
fire and (makes machine gun noise), and everybody was falling to their graves. And a
guy who was standing to me, he was falling like almost first, whatever, but he push me
and I fall like a fraction of a second before him and thus he fall half on top of me. And
then other people were falling on me and I was choking for lack of air, and I said, �God,
please don�t let me die just because of the lack of air.�

Suddenly I heard the voices, because the people were screaming like the last greeting to
their god. �Oh, my God. Eloheinu Eloi, Eli, Eli.� Suddenly there is change of the
voices, and I heard the Germans. �Zur�ck, zur�ck! Partisan are coming.� The partisans
are coming through the woods, so they quickly drop everything, jump on the trucks and
rushed away, not covering the graves with the sand, because this was�this time the
partisans own all territory outside of the towns. The Germans could only live in the
towns, like in the fortress; nobody ventured, whatever, outside.

Anyway, coming to me, I�immediately when I heard this stuff, I knew that there would
be an evacuation of all this stuff and I start to try to crawl out, because everybody was
moving. The German commanding officer was shooting with the pistol every moving
body. So finally I was crawl out of these bodies (makes breathing sound) and was able to
breathe. But I lay still. I was afraid to move because I didn�t know what was going on.
But no noise, no voices, so I figure I have to escape from this grave. When I came to the
corner, no way I can climb out the grave. I have to build a ladder. And I start to look for
small bodies, about�well, I bring this stack bodies, including this Jewish boy, this two�

12



not two, one daughter, because one was covered by the father and I only saw the blond
hair under her father�s body. I couldn�t move.

So I finally collected about four bodies�children, more or less, teenager. It�s very hard
for me to drag them over the dead bodies to this corner, and any attempt to build the
ladder to climb was futile because this was soft. Every body was giving up under the
weight, even though I didn�t weigh too much. So I decided, well, I�ll wait in other corner
till�I know from my father and so on; he was teaching us about rigor mortis and all this.
You have to wait about six hours or more before the bodies start to get stiff.

And when I laying there and watching the stars above me, I saw some yellow eyes
looking down on me. I said, �Oh my God, it�s probably wolf who�s going to devour me
after, when I climb out.� And I said, �I have to; if they find me, they will just shoot me.�
So I finally, again, try to put these bodies on the top of each other and I finally�this was
already almost sunrise time�climb out from the grave. And immediately when�this
was like a little lake there, and I remember that in wintertime I used to go with my father
secretly to cut a Christmas tree there because this was forbidden by the Soviets. So I
wash off, because I knew that the Germans, when they see this, they will put the dogs,
and scent of fear, and also scent of blood, this is indication what the dogs will go for. So,
ice cold water already in the pond, I wash off completely, wash my head off. And after I
walk to this pond for a long time till I found the entrance to the brook, and walking the
brook I got to the woods, under some big oak tree, cover myself with leaves, and fall
asleep.

Well, this was my different odyssey now started. I was nobody. And everybody, looking
at me, half naked, obviously you�d be thinking that I am escapee Jewish boy. So, several
nights and days I tried to find out�going on the edge of forest to one village to another.
In one I found the laundry hanging, and I crawled there on the ground to steal the pants
and some potatoes had been collected. And somebody saw me and they start to sic the
dogs after me. �You Jewish�blah, blah, blah,� I heard in Byelorussian, and they sic the
dog after me. And I start running towards the woods and the rock was almost hot on my
feet, when suddenly a big growl, growling, came out from the woods. I look on this, and
this was big animal, half mastiff half German shepherd. I call him immediately Monster,
and he was savior for me; but I was afraid to enter the woods again because of him, so I
slept in the hay sack. I got an allergy from there. And so, this animal was following me.

Finally, I found a village who have a little better houses with clay roof, and was a church:
on the steeple, regular Christian cross, not Byelorussian. So I feel good: it must be
Polish, maybe these people will help me. But when I walk into the village, all the dogs
start to bark. I was banging different doors; nobody answer. Finally, about the third door
or fourth door, I don�t remember, was open. There was little old woman looking at me.
�What you want?� I said, telling the truth, �I am son of Judge so and so, and I seeking

13



help, some food.� So she let me in and she gave me milk and piece of bread. Boy, what
a feast this was. And after the family came back from the church, and everybody was
surprised, looking on me with suspicion, you know, who are you? And I explained to
them, truthfully, everything what had happened to me.

Okay, this guy was saying, �Well, you�re a truthfully speaking boy (inaudible). And
we�ll help you little bit.� So first, I have a good meal. And they make me the lantern,
what I can use as a fire source. And lantern�the boys in the pasture over there, they
making. It was a regular can: they make the nail holes on the bottom, attach the wire to
the top so you can swing this and put the cow manure inside to light this stuff. So you
can swing this in the air during the day and you can have a fire all day and night. So this
was very�they said after, when I was leaving�at night, they told me to leave so nobody
will see me. And the girls found big bones, and they said, �This is for your Monster,�
this big huge bone.

So, I came back to the woods. I heard him rustling nearby. I have finally some kind of
tarp to lay down, so I said, �Monster, come in. I have food for you.� And he didn�t, so I
throw this bone in the front of the bushes. His mouth came out and he grabbed his bone
and he went back. Okay. I went to sleep and was cold, and suddenly I felt warm on my
back. I said, �What the hell is this?� I turning my head, and here was this dog laying
next to me, warming my body. I couldn�t believe it. This was a godsend animal, you
know. So we survived this way for many weeks. I taught him�maybe he knew how�to
catch the rabbit, you know, because I already forgot how�I didn�t have implements to
make this kind of device to catch the rabbit. And he finally catched [sic] the rabbit,
brought me, and I roasted this rabbit on the fire�oh, this was some unbelievable food!�
and ate it.

So finally, when the snow fall down�I don�t know, this must be November or December.
I lost the day count. I didn�t know what day is today, what day of the week is day, what
the month: just survival was counting. And suddenly at night, or early in the morning,
the barking of the dog wake me up, and here in front of my provisional tent they were
standing, bearded men with their rifles. They was Russian partisans who were blowing
up the railroads or bridges, the same like the Polish partisan�Polish Underground Army.
So they took me to the Russian partisan camp. There was next camp was Jewish, mostly
escapee from ghetto. And I met�they ask for some people, escapee from ghetto in
Slonim. And he said, �Oh, yes, we have here a doctor.� I was ready to see a familiar
face, but is coming suddenly a different person. And I recognize in him Abraham�I
forgot the last name now.

He was the one who was in prison with my father, and he was without any food,
anything. He was like on starvation, ready to die, almost, �cause the majority of the
Jewish people died there and they brought the bodies to execution place. And once, my

14



father saw through the peephole from his cell red beard of Abraham. This was his friend
during the Russian occupation; he was a pharmacist. And Abraham ask my father,
�Michael, if you can, please help me. We are dying.� So my father said, �Well, be here
tomorrow at a certain hour, because we are going to get the water and the crate. I�ll try
and throw you something.� And my father, whatever he had�because all the guards,
they liquidating all the food what my mother was bringing, eating themselves, so only
like an onion or apple or piece of bread they let go.

So my father knew that this man is on the verge of dying, and he took his bread what he
saved for himself and find an onion and an apple. And when he was getting the water in
the yard, he throw through this crate where Abraham stick his�this�and he grabbed this
stuff. And this situation was repeating several times. And he saves Abraham�s life this
way because after, when the typhus blew up full force in the city, they let Abraham out in
disinfection column and, according to my mother, he came several times to our home
bringing some flours and different vital products, or whatever he was able to find out.
So, helping each other.

Anyway I met in this partisan camp a commander�his name was Maxim�and I told
him. �Oh, you are son of the Michael�; they already knew the Michael. (laughs) And I
ask him if he could help me some way to get to Bialystok, to my grandmother. I said I
knew that I cannot use the railroad tracks or highway, because this very much guarded by
the German patrols. He said, �Ne volnui.tes�, mal�chik. Don�t worry, young man.� And
he gave me some kind of map showing where these German post are, how to go, how to
avoid this and that, you know. And they gave me a little supply of food, and from there I
start my odyssey with Monster to the west towards Bialystok.

It took us quite a number of days. I decided not to walk during daytime, so only walk
during the wintertime�I mean nighttime, because it was so cold that you shiver all the
time in nighttime. So it�s better to walk and sleep during nighttime. So we made good
progress, with my dog. I call him my dog Monster. We have some very unpleasant
episodes, from Polish peasant this time; they wanted to kill me with the forks in the barn
because they suspected that I have money. Christian cross on the top: there were no
difference, I found, whose religion, whose nationality, no. This is depends on the human
being. If somebody is tolerant towards each other, toward other human being, it�s great;
but lot of people are�I can only pray for them. They not better than animals, including
the Poles.

So, it was a problem with crossing the border. I learn that this district, Bialystok, all this
was by decree incorporated to German Reich. Ostpreu�en Gauleitung, they call. So this
was not more any territory somewhere in Russia, no more any territory in Poland. So you
have to have documents to [be] able to cross. I came to observe the crossing section, and
it was (inaudible), you know: there is the machine gun and there is all the guards,

15



whatever. I knew I cannot go through. The water was too cold to go through; already ice
was forming. So, I figure I will try to go through the railroad bridge with my dog
Monster. And we pick up in the night when it was snowing, heavy snowing; it was the
best cover for us. And we crawling along the railroad tracks opposite to the hut where the
guard was. But first, I made the observation they changing the guard every four hours,
and there were two guards. They were coming out from the hut when the trains were
coming by with the flags and, after, going back.

So I was lucky, crossed the bridge and (inaudible) was almost crossing this guard from
another side, and one of these guard came out to peek. And this was like five feet from
us and he saw us. Before I was able to move or anything, the Monster jump out and went
after his throat. This guy shoot Monster a couple times from his pistol, but Monster
crushed his�another guard run out from the house, and this was the first time that I used
a gun and shoot another person. I shoot this other person, disabling him, and after, I
figured he is now like a prisoner of me. To kill him will be abandoning a witness,
liquidating the witness. And according to my code or morality, taught by my father, you
never kill your enemy when he�s wounded or disabled. If you commit this for your
convenience, this act of murder.

So I ask him in German to show me his identity papers, everything. I made him to swear,
because I found his wife and children�they are somewhere in Austria�that he will
never disclose that he saw me here; that he will report that he killed the dog because he
attacking his friend; and his friend shooting the dog by mistake and shoot him, too, from
the same pistol. So I unload the pistol, unload the rifle, and I told him, �You can call for
help ten minutes after I disappear from here.� I said goodbye to Monster, kiss his dead
body. I was still sentimental, crying about him.

And after, I went in the snowstorm further, further, further, till I was completely
exhausted. And I got to some kind of village from the other side of the border, and I fall
on the steps of a house and I lost my conscious. Well, I wake up in this house after, later.
A kapo took me in. I have pneumonia. It was Christmas time, and I stay with them a
while. He was teacher: he was teaching in regular school, young children, and also gave
the auditions of teaching high school students secretly, because this was forbidden by the
German, to teach any Pole over fourth grade. They supposed to be slave, and they don�t
need the knowledge whatsoever to be slave.

So I stay with them till probably March. And they got me a driver with the cart and
horses, and they brought me to Madame Vilovska apartment again. And my mother was
not there, and my grandmother told me that she went to Warsaw, to my godparents. She
already lost�she knew that I survived the execution because the member of this Polish
family who gave me help, I asked them to convey the message to my mother in
Bialystok, from there in Bialystok�in Slonim. But they waiting all winter and it was

16



very severe winter and they knew that I must perish, perish somewhere. So she went to
the godparents of mine in Warsaw and I said, �Well, I will go to Warsaw, too, right now,�
till she is there, because my grandmother said she may go further to Litzmannstadt�this
was German name; it was L�dz, Polish city�because my relatives in Austria, they own
some factories there in L�dz, and she may get some kind job there. Okay. So, I rush my
mother (inaudible) with dorozka, what is called dorozka; horse-drawn cart, it�s a taxi.
Okay, use as a taxi. And I got to the train.

On the train, during the first portion, train was stopping very often on the rail tracks, and
putrefied smell, stench, was coming from the outside. And I saw the German soldiers
pouring the gasoline on some bodies along the track. And somebody told me this was the
latest convoy from Bialystok ghetto to the way to Treblinka. People who tried to escape
through the floor or other ways either lost their life under the rail, under the wheels of the
rail, or they�ve been shot by the guards sitting outside. So after was liquidation group;
you know, they were burning the bodies.

In Warsaw, I was gypped by the dorozka driver. (laughs) They took about four more
(inaudible) that this was water for the trip to my grandparents, and landed in their house.
So they told me three days ago my mother left. So I figured, what in hell, there is no
security. Just to be together doesn�t create security; you survive on your own, if you are
intelligent enough and pragmatic and of good heart, trying to help other people, these
people who help you back. But I decided to stay in Warsaw.

The rest was not so much of the Holocaust survivor in there. I was watching liquidation
of the ghetto in April forty-three [1943]. And after finding that my grandfather and
godmother were members of underground, the same like my father was, I asked them if I
can participate, and they gave me some indication means. I was in a Szare Szeregi, what
is the Boy Scouts in Warsaw during the war.1 And my assignment was: find the traitors.
I was like a counterintelligence. Is to find the people who are preying on the Jewish
people, trying to ask them bribes for keeping silence and after giving to Gestapo. And I
got a watch, and my task was to follow this particular individual to get their routes, where
they often eating, where they this, that; and after a special organization was liquidating
these people. But this was nothing heroic on my part.

During the uprising in Warsaw, I was messenger boy, and I was heavily wounded and I
was in hospital. On October 2 [1944] insurgents gave up the fight and surrendered to
General [Erich von den] Bach with condition that we not [be] supervise by any
nationality, not German, like Ukrainian, or Russian. There was a Russian division of

1This was the code name for the Polish Scouting Association during World War II, which contributed to the
Polish Underground movement.

17



people who came on the side; they were criminals, mostly, and they massacre Polish
people during the uprising. They�I don�t want to even say what the horrors were there.

Anyway, the Germans found in my pockets several ammunition pieces for German part
of this pistol, and I was declared a combatant and I was taken unconscious from hospital
to the train and, after, to some German hospital. I never know where the German hospital
was. I was mostly unconscious because I was several infection, ready to die, and the
German doctors trying to save me. So they gave me an injection after one operation and
removing another fragments of bullets. So, I was very, long time in German hospital.
After, I beg the doctor to let me go because I am underage, and so he let me go. This was
somewhere in December, or whatever, I don�t remember. I have a very bad memory from
this time because I was malnutrition, also, at the time.

And I found my mother in February 1945 in L�dz with my sister. We were starving, but I
remember I was going through all garbage places where the people dump their garbage,
looking for potato peels where it be not rotten. And we are hunting for rats. I was
dissecting the rats, and my mother, from the legs of the rats, can�she have a little
handful of flour. She make so-called zurek�soup, Polish soup. This was our mainstay in
the food. We finally cry for help to my grandmother in Bialystok. She came, she got
some bread from Russian soldiers�this was a big feast�and after, she got the permit to
occupy some Baptist church in Aleksandr�w and the position of the teacher in
Aleksandr�w.

TL: If I can have you pause right there, we�ll switch to the next tape and then we�ll pick
up the story there. Okay?

GT: Yeah.

Part 2 ends; part 3 begins

TL: This is tape three with George Jerzy Turlo. Mr. Turlo, if I can take you back for just
a minute to your father, if you can tell us something about your father�s fate, coming from
his imprisonment.

GT: Okay. Mostly what�s happened to my father I haven�t witnessed. I only learned
from his memoirs, published in 1951 in Austria. And this testimony on his part was
something who motivate me, after, to look into my soul and try to write something about
the Holocaust.

18



Okay, after I disappear from Slonim, anymore I was not there. My father was taken for
interrogation by Gestapo. There were several Gestapo officers. First the older man, who
was sitting behind a desk, tried to persuade slowly and gently to my father that it is better
if you confess everything, and say this is better for your wife and family and this and that.
And my father said, �No, I didn�t belong to any organization. I didn�t know anybody
there.�

So finally, this guy scream, �Enough of this game!� He took the page, what he have a
metal ball on the end, and he hit my father over the head. My father, trying to protect
himself, had two fingers were broken by this page. And my father furiously jumped out
and start to push a desk on this SS officer; then he was hit from the behind and he lost the
conscious. They pull him to sidewall, and there they still were kicking him, breaking his
ribs. And after there was no response anymore from my father, they called the doctor and
the doctor said that is shock of the brain, whatever they call it in Germany�anyway, I
forgot the German word for this, that he is completely like�he cannot say anything or
think anything, he�s worthless.

TL: Unconscious.

GT: Unconscious, have unconscious. They brought him unconscious to another cellar
when he was laying on the floor, cement floor. And after, in the evening, a German guard
�German, not any Ukrainian or whatever, Latvian�ask my father if he can stand up and
to go, and my father puke, whatever, and he get up. They sit on the bench outside of
Gestapo headquarters, and this German soldier gave little flask, and my father smelled
this was vodka and have a sip. And he went back to prison. Most of his acquaintances
have been murdered. He, because he was very stubborn till the end, he never said any
word. The Germans couldn�t find any evidence, any words what could indicate he is
guilty to belong to conspiracy. They decided to let him go�not out of prison, but go to
concentration camp in Germany. That was not really was the concentration camp; this
was labor camp. This what my mother found about my father. We didn�t know about
him at all for a couple years after the war.

We couldn�t survive. Now I�m coming back to the time when my grandmother came to
help us in L�dz. She got the job of the teacher in Aleksandr�w. We got apartment where
we could live. But the major problem was starvation: this was not enough food for four
mouths from poor teacher salary. So my mother decided, �Well, we will go to my
father�s family,� who are peasants, and they living somewhere in (inaudible), what is
village not so far from Czarn�w.

So we pack our belongings, whatever we could, and together with Grandmother, four
people of us. We get to Warsaw, and from Warsaw you have to�I don�t know how we

19



did this. Oh, yeah, we have to hire again a man with the big cart and horses. There were
no bridges connecting Warsaw, Praga in Warsaw. And we drove through the streets, what
I remember still from uprising, all rubble everywhere. We get over the Vistula River to
Praga District, and over there was a railroad station�Dworzec (inaudible), they call�
from where the trains were going to Czarn�w, where we could get close to my uncle. He
promised to wait for us on the railroad station, with horses.

And during the first night of travel, the train would stop in the middle of the field, stop by
the Russians. The Russians told everybody, �Get out from the train,� and if everybody
will be running, they will shoot. And they took all the money, all the documents, all
valuable from every passenger on the train. And they robbed my grandmother, too. So
after her return trip to Aleksandr�w she have to get from police bureau in Czarn�w
special affidavit that she was robbed on the train to be able to go back.

We were welcome by the family of my father. This was his sister, my aunt. She married
somebody who was without one leg, and they managed a small little place, you know, in
the countryside. This was a short ride, really, there, because the next winter his own
family throw us out. �You are too many mouths to feed, you don�t have any more sugar,
you don�t have any money, you are useless for us��typical peasant attitude. And we
found again a root cellar. We helped to construct. There was somebody was living there
before, and they kept planks and wooden platform that we could sleep there. In the
bottom of this root cellar was standing water. The rats was climbing every time at night;
you have to fight the rats down. I said, �This isn�t good survival,� after the war.

And finally, in 1946, the first letter from my father arrived. He came addressed, of
course, to her sister, my aunt, so they came running to us with sorry words and this and
that. And my father, when he found that we are alive, he start to send packages with food
and some money; it was like (inaudible) packages. And we�re able to more out from this
root cellar to a one-room apartment somebody rent to us.

And this was a civil war in Poland. The owner of this house was murdered, killed, and
was hanging on the wires next to the house. My teacher in the school also was beaten up
to the pulp by Polish underground, who was against the communist, because he was
helping establish the communist thing. And this was going like this for the next three
years. My mother finally, to the help to my father, was able to move to city Czarn�w and
get a job as a teacher. So we get apartment�again, what we have to share with other
people, but this was okay.

My father, he was in American zone of Austria. And he was working closely with
American organization who was precursor of the CIA, SOS [Office of Strategic
Services], they call. He was instrumental bringing refugee from the Russian zone,

20



occupied Russian zone in Vienna, across the border, very often using the same trick that
he used before: colonel, NKVD uniform, commandeering a Jeep and rushing through the
gates with full force. The KGB�I don�t know what is KGB or NKVD; I don�t know
when they change�they three times try to kill my father. They sent assassins. And my
friend�his friends said, �Mike, we cannot protect you. You better be off immigrate to
United States.� So Father did, in 1951. He was first, as usually immigrants are, working
some menial job in the hospital, pushing dirty laundry and all this stuff. Finally he got
some teaching position in Emmanuel College in Boston. And after, he got position in
Brown University, teaching Russian, Polish and so. So, this was his career here in United
States.

Myself, I finished the high school in fifty-one [1951] and enrolled in polytechnic institute
in Gdansk [Gdansk University of Technology], where after seven years of studying I got
master�s degree in architecture and master�s degree in city planning. So I became master
of everything. (laughs) Anyway, I was working in Poland for eight years, became very
known architect. I build some very interesting hotels in city of Kolobrzeg. After, in
another place, in Slupsk, I design a whole big district, about 24,000 people, and a big new
expansion.

And when I was trying to ask for passport, Polish passport, my mayor came to me and
say, �George, you see the green grass will grow from my hand if you go to United
States.� And he was the former secret police officer, major, or so and so. He know
everybody in this ministry, whatever. So I wrote my father the situation is hopeless,
there�s no way I can get out, and he fix it. I cannot even tell now how he fixed it. I�m
mostly suspicious how he fixed it. Suddenly I got the passport, Polish passport: there in
writing in big letters how he�s grateful of my participation of building this city of Slupsk.
I�m boarding Sabena Airline and am flying directly to New York. And I kissed the
ground when I landed here. And every time when I visit it, Poland, like eight years or ten
years or�I used to go every five years to visit my sister�I kiss the ground in American
airport that I�m lucky be here.

And also I was telling, especially the students when I was teaching about the Holocaust,
you don�t know how great and how good you have here. You don�t know how precious it
is. You are feeling depressed about what? That you are alive? You should smile and
scream from joy. The same way here, I wish all the survivors of the Holocaust, mazel
tov! And shalom! Thank you for your stubbornness to survive. Yeah.

TL: Thank you very much for sharing your story with us. I appreciate everything you�ve
told us about. Thank you.

GT: Yeah.
