Ellen Klein: Today is November 5, 2009. I'm here today with Jeannette Bercovickova 
Bornstein. This is Ellen Klein. And we are here in Clearwater, Florida, United States of
America. Our language today is English, and our videographer from the University of
South Florida is Jane Duncan.

I'm here today with Mrs. Jeannette Bornstein. Would you please spell your name for us?

Jeannette Bornstein: My name is Jeannette, J-e-a-double n-e-double t-e, Bornstein, B-or-
n-s-t-e-i-n.

EK: Okay. And you were born when?

JB: I was born in 1935.

EK: Okay, and what day and month?

JB: January 6.

EK: January 6. Okay. And you were born in which city?


JB: Antwerp, Belgium.

EK: All right. And would you spell the city and country for us, please?

JB: A-n-t-w-e-r-p, B-e-l-g-i-u-m.

EK: Wonderful. Thank you. So, to get started, would you share with us first some of
your experiences before the war that you remember?

JB: Yes. I can tell you that my grandparents were Czechoslovakian, and my parents also
were Czech. Now, in�I don't remember the year, but they moved to France: Lans,
France, L-a-n-s.

EK: All right.

JB: Where my sister was born in 1931. From there we moved to Antwerp, because my
father had a sister who lived in Belgium, in Antwerp. So, we moved to Belgium, and I
was born there in 1935.

Life at home was very pleasant. We lived in a nice community. My sister went to school,
and she played the violin, because our neighbor downstairs played for the Philharmonic
and he taught my sister to play the violin, and she loved it. I was too young to go to
school, and I was a hellion. My mother took me to the park with three outfits so that I
would come home looking clean.

In 1940, rumors started that the Germans were close enough, but nobody paid too much
attention because people thought that it would never happen; the Germans would never
get there during their lifetime. However, the anti-Semitic rumors started to go around,
and indeed the Germans did get to Belgium in�I think it was 1940. We were among
thousands, and my parents knew that it was too dangerous for us to stay. They packed up
whatever they could and, like thousands of others, we ran to catch a train to France,
where the Germans had not yet invaded. We were fortunate to get on that train. The train
was packed like cattle, and I remember�as little as I was, I remember hearing the
continuous noise of bombs. I didn't know they were bombs, but I later found out that
that's what they were.

EK: How old were you then?


JB: I was five. I was crying and I asked my father, �Where are we going?� And he said
to me, �Jeannette, we can't stay in our house anymore.� When I asked him why not, he
said, �Because we are Jewish.� I didn't understand. I was confused and I was scared. By
then, I was six years old.

After many stops, the train let us off in Toulouse and we arrived in France, where we
were hidden in the home�it was a farm, actually�of a gentile family. And there were
many such families who took in Jews that were hiding. They hid them in barns and
cellars and attics. We were hidden in the cellar. It was dark. And, again, I was scared.
But my parents were with me, so that sort of relieved some of my fears.

EK: It was just you and your parents and your sister?

JB: Yes. Yes.

EK: And you told me something before about when you were running to the train station,
about your sister and her violin.

JB: Oh, yes.

EK: Would you tell us about that?

JB: Sure. As we were running to the train station�and we were running: not walking,
running�my father told my sister�my sister was carrying her violin, and my father said,
�Marie, you've got to drop that violin, because you're holding us back.� And as much as
she hated to do that, she had to. And we did get on the train, which was a small train, and
it was packed like cattle. Now, we were in Toulouse, France, hiding in the cellar, and it
wasn't long before the Gestapo squads were making house searches and rounding up all
the Jews that they could find.

EK: Do you know how your family got in contact with the family that hid you?

JB: No.


EK: Okay.

JB: I don�t know that. As I said, there were many families who were sympathetic with
the Jews that were running and hiding, and we happened to come to this family. Now, I
wish I did know who they were, but I don't. And as I said, it wasn't long before the
Gestapo squads were making house searches and rounding up all the Jews that they could
find. And we were captured. My mother, my sister, and I were piled in an open truck and
transported to an internment camp, a German prison camp, which eventually supplied the
slaughterhouse in Poland and Germany. My father was separated from us, and we didn't
know his whereabouts.

EK: Was he taken at the same time, or he was somewhere else when you were taken?

JB: He was not with us. And I don't know where he went. We were sent to Camp
Rivesaltes in Perpignan. It was the southern part of France. And what I can tell you is
that Rivesaltes was a real hell. We lived in overcrowded barracks. We slept on a cement
floor that was covered with a little bit of hay. And we were given a very small space. We
couldn't stretch our arms or legs without touching another body.

EK: Were you kept with your family?

JB: Just my mother and my sister. My father, we still didn't know where he was. We
were cold and always hungry. Our daily rations consisted of a bowl of soup and a piece
of bread. Camp Rivesaltes was our home for nine months. News from the outside, it
trickled in the camp through the underground, and my mother learned that partisan
couriers were able to reach the camp and smuggle children to a safe place. So, in the
middle of one night, my sister and I were awakened, and without any warning or
explanation my mother took us to a designated meeting place and handed us over to these
couriers. I didn't know them. I didn�t know where we were going. I was terrified.

EK: What did your mother tell you?

JB: She didn't tell us anything. She just told us to be quiet, because it was the middle of
the night. And we slipped through the part of�the fence in the camp was not nailed to
the ground, and so we were able to slip underneath the fence. (coughs) And we did meet
with the couriers; as I said, I didn't know where I was going, and I was terrified.

EK: What do you remember about them?


JB: The couriers? No, except that they were big strong men. Of course, I was a little six
year old. They were United States spies that�well, they worked for the United States,
and they took us to an established hiding place for Czech children. We were in Vence, V-
e-n-c-e, in Vence, France. And while we were there we had some schooling, and we were
able to play outdoors. And I mention this because after being in the dark for such a long
time, playing outside with other children was a real treat. And for a while we felt safe
there.

I don't know how, but miraculously my parents found each other, and both managed to
escape their camps and flee to Nice, which is close to Vence. The odds of surviving such
an attempt was nearly nonexistent. Theirs was a fortunate exception. I can only surmise
that their desperation to see Marie and I, perhaps for the last time, they were willing to
risk death. We were reunited in Vence. How they got from Nice to Vence, I don't know.
My father looked like a human skeleton. He was ill, and he died shortly after our
reunion.

EK: Tell me about your father. You told me some things in our pre-interview about him
as a person and what he had hoped for himself and for your family.

JB: My father wanted to be a rabbi, but my mother did not want to be a rabbi�s wife. So,
while we were still in Belgium he worked in a (inaudible) until it closed and we had to
leave. Other than that�and this I was told, because I don't remember my father too well,
except that he was very kind and I know he loved me. Even as a little child, I remember
that. But when I saw him in Nice, or in Vence, he didn't look like my father. He really
looked like a living skeleton. And as I said, he died shortly after our reunion; the cause of
his death were the atrocities that he endured in the camp. It was decided that he be buried
in a gentile cemetery in order not to arouse suspension that there was a Jewish refuge
nearby.

After my father died, my mother remained in Vence. The safety that we felt in Vence and
the few happy days were short lived. We couldn't foresee the danger that laid ahead. The
Nazis were on our backs, and we needed another hiding place. Again, with the help of
the underground, they took us to Creuse, France. It's a small town in the mountains of
France. In Creuse we were taken to an old castle that was given by the owners to Jews on
the run. We hid there until warning came that the Nazis were near, and their mission was
to send every Jew to a concentration camp in Germany.

EK: Do you remember the trip that you made to that castle and how you got there?


JB: No. The only thing that I remember is that we were told not to utter a sound. We had
to be very quiet, not to talk to one another, not to talk to any strangers. That's the only
thing that I can remember. But as far as the trip, I don't know how long it took. I just,
you know, have no idea. And my sister doesn�t either, although she's four years older and
remembers more than I did. We just didn't know how long the trip took.

We had an aunt and uncle in Belgium who had escaped and were living in Spain. Now,
they hired�my uncle was in the diamond business. Now, diamonds could buy you more
than a loaf of bread. You could get very far with diamonds, and that's how they managed
to escape, and they went to Spain. Now, they hired and paid for two couriers that if they
could find us, they would smuggle my sister and me out of France and hopefully to
Spain. Again, my mother was faced with the agony of having to send us away. This time
she told us about the journey that we were about to take, where we were going and why
we had to go. However, despite my cries and my pleas, my promises that I would be
good, she handed us to these strange men again, who led us away. She watched us leave,
knowing that she had no alternative. It was a matter of our survival.

We took the train to the foot of the Pyrenees, and from there we crossed the mountain by
foot. It was snowing and bitter cold. We walked during the night and hid during the day.
We walked single file, and were sternly warned not to utter a sound. See, the Nazis were
all around us and we could hear their gunshot, and if the slightest noise would attract
them, we would be victims of those guns. One night while we were walking, I was so
cold, so tired, so scared that I cried. The reason I cried was that I wanted to hold my
sister�s hand; she was walking in front of me and I went up to hold her hand. Within
seconds, my mouth was taped to keep me silent. I was silent for the rest of the journey.
And to this day, I don't cry.

I don't know how long we walked until we finally reached the border of Spain, and from
there we took a train to Barcelona, where we were met by my aunt and uncle.

EK: Will you tell me something about when you were traveling through the Pyrenees and
you were hiding during the day? Do you remember how you were hid, and did you�
what did you do while you waited for night to fall?

JB: We were hiding behind trees, bushes. I also remember that our feet were frozen.
They were frostbitten because we didn't have proper shoes, and so at one point our feet
were wrapped in newspapers and then put back on our measly shoes. And we were
fortunate that we were not caught.


We were met by my aunt and uncle when we reached Barcelona, the other side of the
mountains. We lived in Spain. My aunt and uncle were strangers to me. I don't
remember them, because I was so young when we all lived in Belgium.

EK: How old were you at this point when you made it to Spain?

JB: I was still six years old. Yeah.

We lived in Spain for six months while waiting for our visas to Canada. However,
bureaucratic regulations would not allow my sister and me visas to Canada, because we
were not registered as my aunt and uncle�s children. Now, their visas were for Canada,
but we could not go with them because we were not their children. And we were wards
of the United States Committee for the Care of European Children, and our visas were for
America. So once again we were separated [from] what had become familiar to us. On
April 7, 1944 we arrived in America, and our first stop here was in Philadelphia. We
were greeted there by the committee, who escorted us to Newark, New Jersey. There we
were placed in an orphanage until a foster home could be found for us.

EK: Can you tell me what it was like when you were making your trip and when you first
got to the United States?

JB: The only thing I can remember is fear. I just can't remember anything except being
afraid, and why did my mother�why did my mother let us go? Why did she leave us? I
knew my father had died. But I didn't understand why my mother had left us. So, I was
afraid, although my sister was with me; that relieved a little bit of the fear. A foster home
was found for us in Providence, Rhode Island. My sister and I lived in the same foster
home until the end of the summer, and then for the first time in our life we were
separated. Nobody wanted two foster children, two refugees. And so my sister went to
live with one family and I went to live with another. We weren't too far apart, and we
were able to see one another occasionally.

Although I missed my sister very much, my new foster family made me feel wanted,
protected, and for the first time free from danger. Since I didn't speak a word of English
when I came here, communicating was not easy, but I learned quickly, because at the age
of ten I wanted to be like every other kid, and I certainly didn't want to be identified as a
refugee. I never talked about my past, I never acknowledged it, and in my quiet shame, I
denied it. It was many years before I understood that my denial provided me the means
to forget the painful experiences of my early childhood.


While I was adjusting to life in America, the Red Cross, with Jewish organizations, were
searching for my mother. It took over a year to discover that she was alive and to locate
her. After the war, my mother went back to Vence and reburied my father in a Jewish
cemetery. It took another five years before she was able to get a visa and the proper
papers to come to America. Seeing my mother for the first time was a shock. She looked
haunted and sickly. I thought that this can't be my mother. I looked at her with the eyes
of the six year old child that she had abandoned. I had to leave the comfort of my foster
parents and rebuild a relationship with my mother.

With time, the events of my childhood surfaced, and I was compelled to recall the events
of my early years in order for my own life to have meaning. I didn't know then, I couldn't
know what was in my mother's tortured mind. But I soon learned that my feeling of
abandonment that I felt for my mother was the bravery and the courage, the self-denial,
and the love that my mother had to save our lives. When I think of the parents today that
would not send their children away, many of them never saw them again.

I can close now. Okay?

EK: You'd like to stop? You'd like to stop?

JB: Can I stop for a minute?

Part 1 ends; part 2 begins

EK: This is Ellen Klein, and we're in Clearwater, Florida, and I'm with Mrs. Jeannette
Bornstein. This is tape two.

So, if it would be okay, let�s go back just very briefly, because I hear you telling me how
it felt for you to feel that your mother had abandoned you and she didn't get to go with
you when you left for Spain. Tell me about that.

JB: As a six year old I did feel abandoned, but of course as I got older I realized that
adults were not allowed to travel during the war. They didn't have visas. They didn't
have any sort of papers, and it was just too dangerous for them to travel. Children they
didn't bother, because children didn't have papers.

EK: Okay.


JB: And I didn't realize this, of course, until I was older.

EK: Right.

JB: Yeah. And when my mother came and we tried to piece some parts of our travels, our
hidings, my mother just could not talk about it. (coughs) It was just too difficult. When
I was older�and as I said, I was still very feisty�there was a time when I really insisted
that she talk to us about it. And I thought I would stroke her out. I really thought she
would have a stroke. She just would not talk about it. And I never asked her again.
(coughs)

EK: So how old were you when you were finally reunited? How old were you when your
sister�

JB: Fourteen.

EK: Fourteen?

JB: And my sister was eighteen.

EK: That's a very different child than six.

JB: Oh, God, yes. And, you know, I had become apple pie American. And here my
mother came, and was just like when I came, didn't speak English. It was very hard. It
was hard to leave my foster parents and to, again, meet someone who was a stranger to
me.

EK: Tell me about that, the first time you saw each other.

JB: The first thing that I can remember is that I didn't want to go. I didn't want to go and
live with her, but of course I had to. She was my mother, and I lived with foster parents.
And I'm just very happy that I came to make amends not only with myself, but also with
my mother.


I am a member�I was a member of the youngest generation of Holocaust survivors. I
was born at a time in history when death was my destiny. In my earliest years, I wasn't
allowed to live. I'm here after all those years thanks to the sacrifice of all those who
dared not tolerate the injustice, and who would not agree that death was my destiny. I
speak to you about the evils of the Holocaust because I am a credible witness, but the
generation of survivors is disappearing. And because of that, I hope that by sharing my
experience, you will stand up to protect the memory of the Holocaust. The memory must
be kept alive.

EK: Thank you.
