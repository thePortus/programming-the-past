CE: Okay. Thank you.

JR: You�re welcome.


CE: And now, we�re going to start with you just telling us your name and spelling it for
us.

JR: My name is Jerry Rawicki. J-e-r-r-y R-a-w-i-c-k-i.
CE: And the date of your birth?
JR: April 30, 1927.
CE: And your age at this moment?
JR: Eighty-two.
CE: Okay, and the city and country where you were born?
JR: I was born in Poland, in the city of Plock.
CE: Okay, could you spell that for us?
JR: P-l-o-c-k.
CE: Okay, thank you. Now, I just want to start with your childhood, and if you could give


us a sense of just what that was like.
JR: My childhood was very wonderful. I remember a very loving parents, sisters, friends,
relatives. We lived in a very beautiful town, an old town dating�oh, thousand years,
back to the time when Poland embraced Christianity. It was a very picturesque town. I
remember playing with my friends with abandon and youthful enthusiasm. But that, of
course, I don�t�well, it�s not like I�m waxing sentimental about the place, because what I
remember unfortunately most about is when I became almost an adult and the war broke
out, and that erased all these beautiful memories of my childhood. That�s�


CE: Okay, okay. Can we see if we can go back and capture a few of those memories?



JR: These good memories you are talking about?

CE: The good memories, yes. Like, who were your friends? Were they mainly Jewish
kids, or�?

JR: No, no. As a matter of fact, I went to a Catholic school. Now, that wasn�t because of
my religious, you know, affiliation. I was a Jew practicing�well, we were assimilated,
my family and I, as quite a few people in Plock were Jews, but the better schools were
private schools. Not that we could afford it�I don�t think we could�but for some
reason, both my sisters attended Catholic school and I sort of�on the basis of their good
grades and good behavior, I pursued the studies over there.

CE: Okay.

JR: And it was a very wonderful school. As a matter of fact, there were�in our class,
there were three or four Jewish kids. It was a Catholic school, but very progressive for
that particular era. What I remember was that whenever�I say progressive, because that
school allowed us Jewish children to have a rabbi come in once a week when the other�
when the rest of the class had catechism, we were leaving the room, and we had a special
other room where the rabbi or assistant rabbi had us for an hour. And what I remember�
to my chagrin, of course�that we hated that particular day, because our friends�you
know, Catholics, with whom we played, with whom we interacted, whose houses we
were invited to�when that happened when we were�our exodus from the class was met
with what I would call anti-Semitic slurs.

CE: Okay.

JR: And it was so�it was embarrassing; that�s why we hated it. It was maybe�because
they were kids our age, and there was nothing�the anger was probably a product of the
anti-Semitism that was evident in Poland for years, for centuries. And they didn�t mean to
maybe cause us any harm or maybe embarrassment, but they would say, �Oh, Jew killer,
Christ killer,� something like that, almost in jest. Some of them, maybe they did mean in
jest. But it was very, very painful, that particular thing.

But other than that, it was a very�we had very, very good�I have very good memories.
I was, for example, participating in plays�Christmas plays, for example�as a matter of
fact, I have a picture I brought with me that shows me in a class, and there is a faculty
and there�s a priest and all that. So, it was very, very nice overall.


CE: Were you a good student?

JR: I was a very good student, and that�s what kept me in school, because I hope you
don�t want [to] ask me whether I was a prankster.

CE: (laughs)

JR: There was�I don�t know whether or not this has anything to do with this interview,
but I�ll tell you. In that school, and I think in all schools in Poland at the time, we had
what we called a black book. Everybody was issued a black book, and that book was a
means of communication, of the teachers with the parent. So if somebody did something,
you know, that was not acceptable, the teacher would write, you know, this black book.
And the parents had to sign it.

Now, with my sisters and with others, that book was never used for a whole year. Mine
was full at the end of the semester. (CE laughs) And I was accused of other things, you
know; there was a vendetta (laughs) against me. But I had good grades, and that�s why
wasn�t expelled.

CE: Did you feel anti-Semitism any other time, other than when you went to be with the
rabbi?

JR: Not as a child. Not until maybe when I was�well, eleven, twelve years old. When
they sort of�when we knew that the war was coming and the anti-Semitism, which was
latent in Poland, you know; it was hidden. Of course as children, we didn�t realize it. But
there was a rise in anti-Semitism right in 1938, thirty-nine [1939], and it wasn�t directed
at me as a child but at Jews on the whole.

What was�this thing was heightened, that feeling of anti-Semitism. And the foreboding
of what was happening for us was that my grandparents, who lived in Germany, in
Hamburg�in a suburb of Hamburg, Altona�were displaced, were ordered to live�to
leave Germany, and they came to live with us. And for the first time, of course, we heard
first-person accounts of what was happening in Germany, although we didn�t have to,
because my father was listening constantly. He was a�like I am today, he was a news
junkie, and he was constantly listening to the radio.


He bought, as a matter of fact, the most expensive�at that time�radio, which was
always a point of contention between my mother and him. She says, �Why did you spend
money on this? We could use the money for other reasons.� But it was a very latest
German radio, and I remember there was a magic eye, that the voice was fluctuating�it
was fascinating for another reason for me than for them. And so, he could listen�he
would listen every evening to the harangues by [Adolf] Hitler or [Joseph] Goebbels or
these other, you know, Nazi big shots. And he understand�of course, my father was
bilingual; he knew German, and he would translate it to us.

And there was another point of contention between my mother and father, because she
says, �Why do you listen to him? These guys, they�re just blowhards. I know Germany.�
She was in Germany as a young kid, she used to be, and she was impressed by the
German culture, by the beauty of [the] Alps and the music festivals and the universities
she was visiting with her adoptive parents. She was an orphan, and she was adopted by a
very rich family, so they traveled. And she says, �Oh, it couldn�t be! It couldn�t be like
that!� And she was contradicting what my father was listening to.

So then, of course, to answer your question, this was when I started to feel Jewish and I
felt the sting of anti-Semitism, because up till then, I was just a Polish kid, you know. I
was a�

CE: Okay. Let�s talk about your family a little bit, like�so, who lived in the house with
you?

JR: Well, we had a�it was my parents and two sisters. We were economically maybe
middle class, lower middle class. My father was a�by trade he was a printer, but he was
in management. He was working for an industrial factory; they were making machinery
and tools�agricultural tools and machinery. And�

CE: And could you say his name for us?

JR: My father�s name was Abraham Rawicki. Abraham. My mother�s name was Sophie.
And my sisters�

CE: Her maiden name was? Her maiden name?


JR: Her maiden name was Finkelstein. And my sisters� name�one was Stephanie; [she]
was four years older than I am�was. And Felicia�was seven years older. She�s the one
who survived the war, and she lives in Israel now.

CE: Okay, so back to�your father was a printer?

JR: He was�he never practiced printing, I guess, because he was working for this outfit
that the owners of that outfit adopted my�the parents of the owners of the outfit adopted
my mother when she was orphaned; maybe she was one or two years old. And she was�
when she became of age and my father married her, he was�he got the job in the factory,
so to speak.

CE: And was your mother German, or was she Polish? She was Polish?

JR: Oh, no, no. My mother was Jewish Polish.

CE: Okay.

JR: They were all Polish Jews, yes.

CE: Okay, all right, every one.

JR: So, this was the�as far the family was concerned, we were�religiously speaking,
we were assimilated. We were�we considered ourselves Poles, but by assimilation; it
doesn�t mean that we abandoned our Jewish heritage. We were�our parents were
observing the Jewish high holidays, and we children were told to go to the synagogue
with them, which sometimes didn�t sit well with us, but we had to acquiesce. And so�so
now I told you about our religious, you know, situation, our economic�

CE: Did your mother work, ever, outside the home?

JR: No.

CE: No.



JR: My mother didn�t.

CE: Okay.

JR: She was not very well, I remember. She was very tiny. Her hair was�I�m told�of
course, I always remember her as having gray hair, and I was told that she was gray when
she was almost a teenager or something like this. And she had varicose veins, I
remember, and at that time, of course, as you know, the medical situation wasn�t as good
as now, so she suffered through that. And she was frail, but very energetic as far as I�m
concerned�sometimes too energetic. (laughs) When we got those�when she got that
black book back, I can still�I was just shaking because I can still feel the sting of her,
you know, hand on my face. Corporal punishment like this was common, you know. So, I
was crying (laughs) before I give her the book.

 CE: (laughs)

JR: But this was�so, that�s how I remember my mother. And other than that, as I say, we
didn�t particularly�didn�t have any luxuries that I can talk about, but we had a very, very
good youthful life and a very loving family. And culturally, we were very lucky, because
both my parents loved�liked music. Our house was always full of record�well, we had
a record player, this old thing that you see sometimes in the advertisements of RCA
[Radio Corporation of America], and we had records. My father had a very good voice,
and he was singing all these songs that were number one at the time, and everything that
was popular. He also listened to opera, to concerts, and things like that.

So in that respect, we were very lucky. We had a small library, you know; we had books
that sometimes I was looking at and I wasn�t supposed to. Again, I would be punished
severely, because I found books that were�my sisters were supposed to read�and my
parents�and I sneaked in and I saw that, you know.

CE: So why weren�t you supposed to read them?

JR: Well, because I was�(inaudible) like Vita Sexualis, for example.1

CE: Oh, okay.

1 Vita Sexualis is an erotic novel by Ogai Mori.


JR: It wasn�t for me. (laughs)


CE: Right, you were too young.

JR: I was too young, but I heard it was good, (laughs) so I looked at it. There were other
books, you know, that I remember. At the time where we were�the day, the night that we
were expelled from our town, I was in the middle of a book. And I was reading it and it
was very interesting, and I took it with me. And as we were walking down the staircase�
we were in a third floor apartment. On each landing, there was a German soldier, and he
hit the book out of my hand. I finished the book three or four years later, after I was in the
United States. It was The Citadel by [A.J.] Cronin.

So, we had�our cultural life was, you know, on a par with whatever other people did in
this town. The town, incidentally, was�for a small town; it was about forty thousand
inhabitants. We had good schools, we had excellent schools. We had a theological
seminary, which was very famous in Poland. We had a cloister, or a monastery, that
produced, you know, theologians. So, we were very lucky in that respect. The town was
very cultural, historical, and a nice place to live.

CE: And one last question: Did your parents emphasize your Jewish identity, other than
going to high holidays?

JR: That was just about the extent of it, I think. Yes. Well, for�you know, I was�in
1939 I was preparing for my bat mitzvah�bar mitzvah�and then, of course, I had a
special tutor.

CE: Yes.

JR: Like an assistant rabbi would come to the house, and at one�as a matter of�excuse
me. At one point, I was going to a religious parochial school once a week to learn, but
again, they [parents] thought better. I do it, you know, at home.

CE: So you didn�t take Hebrew classes or anything?

JR: No, just�I did, just for the�



CE: Bar mitzvah.

JR: For the bar mitzvah. Yeah, yeah.

CE: Okay. Now, can you remember a point at which this all changed?

 JR: Well, that changed when�it came to an abrupt halt when the Germans, of course,
invaded Poland in September of 1939. The first thing that really affected us is�I
mentioned to you that my father had a mid-level management position. His assistant, or
maybe co-worker, was a gentleman by the name of Gross. He was an ethnic German, and
in our town, there were quite a few ethnic Germans. As a matter [of fact], there was a
Lutheran church, or Lutheran or Protestant church. And he happened to be an ethnic
German, and I remember him.

When I was five, six years old, I would sometimes come to my father�s office, and he
was there. And I remember the desks were facing each other�my father was on one desk
�and he would take me on his lap, Mr. Gross, that ethnic German. And he�I loved the
way he played with me. He let me play with the things�the abacus, you know; at that
time this was for computing things�and with the paper punch�what do you�?

CE: Hole puncher?

JR: Yeah, hole puncher, that. And when the Germans came in, my mother�my father had
to leave suddenly. It developed that this Mr. Gross, who�s supposed to be our best friend,
conspired�he says that my father, you know, did something�sabotaged, you know. And
my father was just about to be arrested, so he left for Warsaw. So we were left alone, my
mother and my two sisters. So, this was the first shock, so to speak.

The same�talk about this Mr. Gross. Before that happened, in the first few weeks, the
Germans, of course, declared that Jews could not have many, many things, among them
furs. Now, I mentioned to you that we weren�t very rich, but we had furs. My mother�s
two brothers were furriers in London, so they would send her most expen�well, at that
time, you know, mink, seals and all kinds of things�I remember karakuls; that was a
name for that. And when this decree told us that the Jews cannot have furs, naturally we
stored them at Mr. Gross�s and his wife, hoping that after the war we�ll get it, but that was
it.


So, this was the first shock. Then, of course, the restrictions, you know; the occupation
was becoming more and more difficult. There were restrictions, there were
proclamations, there were�then, of course, the most important thing is we happened to
live in a Jewish section of town. But Jews who did not live in the particular sections were
told that they had to move to the Jewish section. So naturally, the crowd�every Jewish
family had to accept at least one other family, usually neighbors or possibly relatives.
And we did�I remember one family that we accepted, and�there was�we were
crowded, of course; we were completely out of our normal rhythm, as to speak�so to
speak. But these were the things, but they were still nothing compared to what came
later.

Right now the Germans were�we were in what I call Phase I of the German
extermination, which was designed to make us completely out of our way of life. Made
us so uncertain what was coming, we didn�t know whether we were coming or going. The
Germans were�the proclamations and these�all kinds of restrictions were coming fast
and furious. Not as much, I think, to make us think, but to make us confused.

So today, for example, the printers over there must have had a mint�must have been
making a mint, because in the morning there was a�there were posters plastered all over
the place that we were supposed�for example, the curfew was at five o�clock. Three
months�three hours later, there were posters that claimed no, it wasn�t five, it was four-
thirty, something like that. Just to confuse us. But this was still nothing that we really
worried that much, at least we as the children.

But then, of course, came the deportation, which I mentioned, too. You know, that day
that I was reading The Citadel and we were�may I use this for a second?

CE: Please, yes.

JR: (blows nose) We were told to take�I was going to say all our belongings�the
belongings that we would carry with us, and get in front of the houses to wait to be
transported. Where, we didn�t know. And we were waiting in a drizzling rain�this was
right after midnight, and I don�t think the flatbed trucks came for us until maybe dawn, so
we were standing there in this freezing rain. One of the things that, again, it�s difficult for
me to even talk about it, but I�ll try to reconstruct it. The street that we lived on was
called Broad Street.

CE: Broad?


JR: Broad Street, and it was broad; there was a strip of lawn greenery in the middle of it.
And we were standing, waiting�we were waiting for these things. It was freezing, and
the Germans were of course patrolling the thing. And right across the street, there was�a
good friend of mine lived, and all of the sudden I decided�you know, I was bored with
this. My mother was there and all that. And I said, �Oh, I�ll see my friend.� And I thought
I would run over in my�I was arguing with my mother about other things, you know,
while we waited�but then I said, �Okay, I see him.� And my mother right away says,
�Come back!� And as she yelled, I also heard the German say in German�[at] that time I
didn�t know it. �Raus!� I knew that he wanted me to go back and I came back, and he
came over and he pointed a rifle at me. Of course, at that time I didn�t realize that, but
now, I realize how my mother must have felt.

But finally, you know, we were�the trucks came in, flatbed trucks, and we were loaded
on them and they took us away from Plock. We didn�t know where we were going or why
we were�well, we knew why, but we didn�t know where. And we wound up, after a
long, long trek in rain and sleet and all that, up in East Prussia, which was north of
Poland. It was way north of, you know, our place. This was our first two nights that we
spend outside of our home. And it was most notable thing for humiliation and cruelty that
I can think of, considering all the other cruelties that I�ve witnessed.

We were housed for two nights in a big�it was either a school or a campus, some kind of
a campus. It might have been a college, because it was big. And on the floor�there was
no�there were classes�the classroom were open, but there were no chairs, no tables,
just straw that we could lie on. And I forgot to mention to you that the four thousand Jews
from Plock, we were divided into groups. So our group of about eight�six hundred
people�were sent to this particular place in East Prussia called�the city was Soldau.

CE: How do you spell that?

JR: S-o-l-d-a�a-u. Soldau.

CE: Okay.

JE: As a matter of fact, this city�I don�t know if you happen to�there was a movie,
Valkyrie, the other�a movie was just made, Valkyrie, about the�

CE: I haven�t seen it.


JR: �assassination of Hitler and all that. And there was something about Soldau in it.

But anyhow, we were housed there for two days. So, the classrooms were open�
classrooms were open, but the restrooms were closed. And that was, of course, up�north
of Poland�Polish border. East Prussia was almost, you know�very north. It was
freezing. It was still sleet, freezing. There was a soccer field that was frozen; it was�
maybe it was made into a skating ring or something. And that�s what everybody who to
have biological function, they had to relieve themselves right there in open. So, this was
the first humiliation that I remember out of many humiliations that were to come later,
but this was the first one.

For whatever reason�of course, we still didn�t know where we were going�they put us
on a train�on a regular train; it was not one of those cattle trains that we know. And we
were heading south. I remember that the train stopped in Warsaw, and I looked out and I
was never in a big city outside of Plock, you know, at that time. I was�as a matter�any
city, except one down maybe three�twenty-five miles from us, for a day or so. But I was
never out of Plock.

And here I was in Warsaw, and we saw the�we stopped at the railroad station, and I was
thinking to myself, Oh, my, wouldn�t it be something if I could go out (coughs) and could
see our father. Of course, we weren�t allowed to leave; the train must have been sealed.
And we went�after this stop they unloaded us south of Warsaw, way south of Warsaw.
And then once we embarked on the train, we were (blows nose)�we were transported by
wagons, where horse and�

CE: Horse and buggy?

JR: Yes, you know, this kind of transportation, wagon driven�horse driven wagons for
this way here. And again, our groups was divided because on the train was about five�
eight hundred people, so maybe three or four hundred of us landed in a little place�I
don�t know what they call [it], village, hamlet�named Bodzentyn, B-o-d-z-e-n-t-y-n.
And we were dumped, so to speak, on a Jewish population maybe of hundred families.

CE: Did you know most of the people?

JR: Pardon me?

CE: Did you know most of the people who were traveling with you?


JR: No. I mean, as a kid I�d�well, neighbors and so on, but we knew them by name. My
mother probably knew them; some of the sisters did. But I�if they were my friends, yes.
There was three or four of them that were my friends, and of course them I knew, but that
was about all I know, all the people I knew.

And that�s where the hell broke loose. There were two rich Jewish families in that
particular city; they were trying to help us, but the rest of them were what I think
impoverished Jews. In Jewish language we refer to this location�as a shtetl; it�s a small
little town. And these people were just overwhelmed with our arrival, as we were
overwhelmed with what we saw. There was not�we were housed in what was previously
their storefronts.

For example, on this one street that we lived in Bodzentyn�in that one storefront, there
were three families. We had four cots, you know, against straw burlap�you know, filled
straw�straw burlap�burlaps filled with straws. I believe in this, our storefront that we
lived, was a little cubicle that had a toilet. That�s about it. We had no facilities to drink
anything, we had no facilities to take a bath, and of course with that was lack of
sanitation. If you combine this with the lack of food and the terror that went with it, I
don�t know what was the worst, whether it was the hunger or the epidemic.

We were covered with lice, and I mean covered literally speaking. We could not�the lice
were just crawling. These were the types�we called it clothing lice [body lice] because I
know even in this country people�there is such a thing as head lice, but you know, it�s
nothing serious because it can be, you know�if you have the medication and all that,
you can get rid of it. These were what they call clothing lice that were in our clothing, in
the seams of our clothing, and it was impossible to get rid of them unless killing them.
And there were thousands in between our nails�fingernails. There was nothing we could
do about it.

The problem is compounded�was compounded by the fact that they spread typhus.
Typhus, of course, now is almost eradicated, but whenever it strikes it�s deadly, and even
if there is medical help. But, of course, we had no medical help. So we were decimated in
this particular town by typhus and by hunger. If people did not even�people who did not
die from typhus, they died from hunger.

CE: Did you get any food? I mean, what�


JR: We were�there was a kitchen, a communal kitchen that the Germans established.
And we had these�every family, the head of the family�in [my] case, it was my mother
�had a utensil, a pitcher. It was an earthenware pitcher. I still remember that pitcher. And
people were trying to get as big a pitcher as possible, because they felt, you know, if the
big pitcher, the soup�(laughs) it was soup; it was a euphemism for water�actually vice
versa; there was nothing there. And we would line up over there and it would be ladled
out, you know, whoever. In our case it was four of us, you get four ladle of that
supposedly soup.

It was water that was boiled. Maybe there were�I don�t know exact measurements, but
just [to] give you an idea: If there was twenty gallons of water in this big kettle, maybe
they put one pound of potatoes, and the potatoes got to a point where they were
completely mushed together. And this was the thing. There was no nutrients in it; there
was no caloric values. So as a result, there was widespread hunger.

Occasionally, we were helped by some of the locals. The most amazing thing is�and
today when I was waiting for you I did my thing that I�ve doing it for the last five years.
When this business was�this museum was established�I know this is a side story, but
you might be�

CE: That�s okay.

JR: �interested to know. I just happened to be looking at the library that was very small,
you know�now, of course, we have quite a few books, but it was maybe one two
shelves. And just by coincidence, there was a little book, yellow covers, this big.
Coincidences only happened to me. Why? The, book lo and behold, was about
Bodzentyn, and how we, the refugees, were thriving in Bodzentyn. The pictures of
Bodzentyn was comparable to what you see now in Darfur, or used to see in Biafra, or
used to see in Rwanda�I mean health-wise and hunger-wise. And here I see this book.

I remember when I got home I was stupefied, and I called up�you remember I told you
there was one friend of mine who was in Bodzentyn with me. He�s still in California. And
I told him about this book, and he says, �Oh, come on, you kidding, just telling a story.
You�re lying.� I say, �No, it is.� A couple weeks later, I went back to get the book. I
cannot find it. It�s there somewhere. I was hoping that maybe one of these days there will
be some bibliography, that will say�the book started with �Bodzentyn,� you know�and
(inaudible). Today, as a matter�I came in ahead of you. I got here an hour�and I was
looking right there.2

2 Referring to The Last Selection: A Child�s Journey through the Holocaust, written by Goldie Szachter Kalib
with Sylvan Kalib and Ken Wachsberger, University of Massachusetts Press.


CE: And you didn�t find it?


JR: No.

CE: Maybe you and I can look together and find it.

JR: It�s just�I think�

CE: Do you remember anything about the book?

JR: I think of course, but my memory has failed me before. It was a small book, like this,
paperback, and I think the cover was yellow. So I�m looking at yellow everything, but
who knows. But anyways, it was such a shock. And they mentioned the family over there,
Szachter family. This was one of the rich families. When I saw this word�it was
�thriving� or something to the effect�I said, �Oh, my God!�

CE: Could you tell who wrote the book?

JR: No, I couldn�t.

CE: Was it a German or?

JR: No, it was somebody, and I think�at that time I was so shocked. It was some Jewish
survivor, or somebody from New Jersey. He was in New Jersey. But I cannot offer you
any more. And I�ll tell you, of course, it is a Sisyphus work. I cannot do anything about it
anymore. But every time I come to this place�and I come very, very often�I�m drawn
to that library, because I figure maybe I�ll find it. But I�this is a side thing. Anyhow, this
is�

CR: How long�

JR: �an example of you�sometimes you cannot believe what you read or something;
what was the saying? Excuse me; you wanted to ask me something?


CE: That�s okay. I just wondered how long were you in this town?

JR: I would say in Bodzentyn we were probably�okay, we came in in winter time. Not
quite a year.

CE: Okay.

JR: Or maybe a year. Was there�oh, I�m sorry. I�m sorry, a year and a half.

CE: A year and a half.

JR: A year and a half, because�that�s right, a year and a half, because we had one winter
over there. Yeah.

CE: So how did you spend your time there?

JR: Trying to disinfect ourselves, trying to get rid of the lice. I was hired�I hired myself
to bury people who were dying from hunger and those, so I would dig graves from them.
It was nothing; it was just absolute helplessness. And I told you about another thing there
�certain things that are so etched in my memory, or maybe in my sense of smell are the
memory.

We were restricted to this one street, you know. It was, of course, a ghetto, but without a
wall. And there was a bakery somewhere on the outskirts of this thing. And the smell of
fresh baked bread�when it wafted in, it was just excruciating. I can only compare from
what I read and from what I know about narcotics, narcotic agent�addicts. You know,
how they crave a fix. They don�t know; they just get out of their mind, especially if it�s
hard narcotics like cocaine or whatever. It�s there. That�s how we felt.

So when you ask me what we did, I don�t know, but there we were, just spending the time
�dreading the time when the smell of the bread will come. And that was just nothing,
waiting from�to get, you know, during the mid-day, when my mother had to go get that
soup that was rationed to us.

CE: You just got that one time a day?


JR: One time a day, yes. It was just�oh, yeah, it was�and it was a piece of bread or
something for everybody, you know, but it was just� But this was the extent of our life
complete. And when I�when the people ask me, of course, then of course I will be
telling you about when I�when we went to�when we landed in Warsaw.

If anything, of course, the Warsaw Ghetto�and large ghettos like Lodz, large Polish
cities�primarily Warsaw is symbolic of the suffering, of the hunger, and of the disease
and of the brutality. I think that the life in those small towns matched brutality for
brutality, hunger for hunger, disease [for] disease, anything that was happening in a larger
ghetto. Maybe more so, because in the Warsaw Ghetto, as I will tell you later, there was
some help, self help that carried over from before the war.

In these small ghettos, there was nothing. There was just unmitigated brutality and
hunger and death. Especially it was so vivid in my memory, because later in Warsaw�of
course I wasn�t a Warsovian, you know, I was born in Plock. But in this Bodzentyn that
I�ve been telling you about it, I knew people. I knew our teachers, our doctors, our�you
know, people, notables that we looked up to. We were supposed to�in good times we
had the benefits of their�sometimes largesse, sometimes, you know�or friendship.

Now, we saw them skeletons, or maybe before even they were skeletons. They were
reduced to just�they were eviscerated of every human attribute, and this was very
painful to see. Before even I buried them, you know, with this�in this little cemetery that
�

CE: (sneezes)

JR: Bless you.

CE: Thank you.

JR: So, that what we�that was our life in this particular little town. I might also mention
to you that there was no�because I mentioned to you�see, as I talked to you, now
certain things come into my mind. I mentioned brutality right now. I mentioned to you
that all I did is the hunger and the epidemic. There was no German garrison in this
particular town, but there�the garrison that was�the town, was serviced, so to speak, by
the garrison from a little town, Bielany, which was about twenty-five, thirty miles away.


But once a week, the gendarmes from that other place came into Bodzentyn, and it was a
day of carnage. Nobody dared (blows nose) to go on a street when three or four
gendarmes came in on this particular day. One of them�the name of one of them was
[Dunkle]; I don�t think it was a relation.3 But he�which was very unusual�he had a
lame leg. And you know in Germany, if you were handicapped or something you were
persona non grata; sometimes you were relegated to lower class and all that. But he was
very valuable to them. He was a born killer, and when he came in to our town, we knew
somebody was getting killed, one or two people. And, you know, it was a small town, so
when two people get killed, you know, it was a�

I was telling you I remember when this German soldier pointed a rifle at me. There was a
very similar�maybe, of course, worse situation with this [Dunkle]. You know, I was�
because I was maybe not smart, or I was�it carried over from my prankster life. You
know, before the war. I was happy-go-lucky. I didn�t know half the time what I was
doing. And when [Dunkle] and his guys came to town, all we had to do�we just were�
the storefront, the floors had windows, so we were constantly looking at the street.

I don�t know what made me jump up, out of the�we were allowed to walk in the street,
because it was within the ghetto area, but not when [Dunkle] was in town. He spotted me.
And my mother was at the window, you know; she saw that. And he took me by the
collar, and he�s pushing me�taking�pushing me somewhere. Around the corner there
was a bar�a restaurant�bar, really. On occasions I used to go to this bar, and this
woman allowed me to clean things, help and all that, so she do.

It was in the afternoon, I think, and the door opens to the thing and she sees [Dunkle]
comes in with me over there. And without any, you know, further ado, so to speak, he
takes out his pistol. As I say I was stupid, go-lucky. I don�t think I realized what was
happening. But she did, the owner of this, Ms. Bielanska. And she was�must have been
petrified, because she knew what was coming. And she came out from behind the bar,
and jokingly she said to him, �Hey what are you going to do? I just had my�I just had
my floor cleaned.� And he had one of his hand on me�I was�and she said to him,
�Come on, get a drink.� And to me, �Get the hell out!� and she kicked me.

CE: Wow!

JR: (blows nose) When I got back, I got a beating from my wife�from my mother,
because she saw this.

3 After the oral history interview, Interviewee corrects: �This man�s name was Dunkle.�


CE: Can we stop here?

JR: Sure.

CE: For a little bit, okay.

Part 1 ends; part 2 begins

CE: All right, this is tape two. Today is July 1, and this is an interview with Jerry
Rawicki. Jerry, could we go back for just a moment, back to your childhood and talk
about some of the activities that you were involved in?

JR: Well, personally, I was very much into sports. I was very good in track and field. As a
matter of fact�I remember now you talk about physical training. You know, I follow
tennis and other sports and I see how important it is to have trainers and all that. And I
remember there was a type of�I was what, maybe ten, and I was participating in all
these track meets. And I remember somebody�he wasn�t a trainer; he wasn�t getting
paid for it, I�m sure, but I remember he told my mother that I should have before a meet
chicken soup with rice. I don�t know why. If I told these to trainers, you know, who train
these tennis players now, he�ll probably laugh at it. But anyhow, this was� (clears
throat) but this is something that always I remember.

But I was very much also in gymnastics. We have a Maccabi team, which is of course�
Maccabi even now is famous for its sports all over the world. And the Maccabi had a
soccer team; of course, I was too young for that. But we also had a very gymnastic
program, and I was very good on parallel bars and on the horizontal bar. We had weekly
training sessions, and I loved it! And I was very good at it.

My coach�we didn�t call him coach at that time; it was just an instructor. And I
remember him. He looked like a [Arnold] Schwarzenegger; he was built like a Greek
god, and we all worshiped him and all that. And he was saying to my parents that I had
Olympic future, you know; of course he might have been exaggerating. But anyhow, I
was good for my age and for my size. As a matter of fact, this is again�I loved it, and I
almost�I was so excited about it, you know, every spare moment I remember of mine
was devoted to gymnastics.

But after the war, I was�I had pleurisy, I believe, and I was sent to a sanitarium. I had a
sponsor, was a guy that was a high-ranking officer in Polish army, and he made it�
arranged for me to go to a clinic to recuperate after this pleurisy, I think; pleurisy or


something like that. And that clinic was full of Russian soldiers and officers. That�s
where I learned how to play tennis, because one time, there was a Russian officer�he
was a Tartar or Mongol�and I saw him in pajamas over there, hitting the tennis ball over
the net. So I figured I�d go down�I couldn�t even speak Russian�over there, but we
communicated. He gave me a racket, and the first time in my life I hit the ball back and
forth without any problems.

But this�I�m not talking about the (clears throat) tennis right now. They also had a gym,
and I saw in the gym parallel bars. And like a fool�for four years I haven�t been on�
five years almost�on the horizontal bars�I just jumped on. And I had the most
unbelievable pain because I was skinny and everything, and the bars weren�t adjusted,
you know. I think that this was the cause of my problems ever since; you know, I had two
operations on my rotator cuff. I had problems with this rotator cuff. I think that�s what
was caused�

CE: If you did that.

JR: But anyhow, this was what I was going to mention to you that�

Pause in recording

JR: As a child, gymnastic was a part of my life. I loved it, and it carried over to this�not
gymnastics, but sports�even to this time. Also, I was telling you about�and this is
important; I�m glad that I thought of that. I was telling you that I participated in those
meets, the track and field, hundred meters and sixty meters. And I used to win quite a few
of them, and that came very handily later on.

CE: I was going to say, I wondered if some of this didn�t come into your life to help you
survive everything that you went through.

JR: Yeah. Oh, yes, during the war and especially in Warsaw Ghetto, you know�I�ll have
a chance to talk you later about it. My speed was very important, saved me.

CE: Let�s go back to�so, your time in Bodzentyn. You were there for a year and a half,
you said.


JR: I was there for a year and a half, and my sister�the younger sister, older than me but
�Stephanie�was stricken by typhus. And not because they wanted to help her, but they
were afraid that, you know, that she was going to spread it everybody�typhus that was
already incubated, you know, it was a threat to the whole community. So they took her to
some kind of larger city to a clinic or a hospital. And she survived.

I remember the day when she came in again, on a horse driven wagon covered with straw.
And she came in�she was a skeleton. And of course, she stayed in the same, you know,
state of her health, because there was nothing to eat. She�there was no way of us to
bring her back to some kind of health. So she was surviving, but as a skeleton. And the
stories were becoming more and more frequent about the deportations to some other
places, and we figured, you know, if we going to be deported again, it certainly wouldn�t
be just as good a paradise as our Bodzentyn, it would be probably worse. And I use
�paradise,� of course, you know in what sense.

So, my older sister and I decided that we would go to Warsaw, while my mother and sick
sister will stay. And when she gets a little but better�you know, she maybe gains some
weight�we will be�we�ll arrange for my mother and her to come to Warsaw to join our
father.

CE: Had you any contact with your father at all?

JR: Yes, we had mail�there was occasional mail. And we knew that he was in Warsaw,
but this was just about it. But there was no telephone�we had no telephone in this little
town that we could use. So, my sister and I decided we would go to Warsaw. Now, I
mentioned to you before that in that town, which was not a ghetto�but it was a ghetto;
we were restricted as to our movements, and it was just about one street. It was a main
street, Langiewicz Street, which we were supposed to�we could frequent but nothing
else. Anything beyond that, if a Jew was found out�and this was, of course, the same
thing in any other ghetto�once you were outside of the designated area, you would be
shot; you would be killed.

So, we decided we�d leave the town. The town did not have a railway station. The nearest
town was sort of an industrial town�a small industrial town about twenty-five, thirty
miles. And we knew when we were sitting right here, as I was sitting in front of our
storefront where we lived, I knew that that town�was called Wierzbnik-Starachowice�
was there. That�s all we knew.

My sister and I one night, one evening, decided to walk to this town, which we knew had
a railroad station. And we knew some people, because I mentioned to you that we were�


when we sent south�you know, when we were divided�and some of our friends were
sent to this other town. And right out�sort of the outskirts of town we had a forest, and
we knew that on the other side of the forest twenty miles away is that other city.

And we walked. My sister and I� (coughs) excuse me. My sister and I walked one foot
in front of the other one. (coughs) And we had no compass. We had nothing.

CE: And no food?
JR: No, no food. And we just walked. At the�maybe after walking for six or seven
hours, we finally saw lights, and we knew that we already had a point where to go. We
got to the house�we got to the station, and�I�m sorry, to that city. We found out that
these friends of ours, they give us some money for the tickets.

CE: How did they have money?
JR: Well, he was�there was some people who had money; they had money in our town.


They were�he happened to have money all his life. When he came to the United States,
he had a jewelry store in Chicago. He gave�when we got married, he gave me the ring.
CE: Wow! But were they in a ghetto situation in that town?
JR: Oh, they were also in a ghetto.
CE: In a ghetto situation. But this was money that they had taken with them from their


home?
JR: Oh, yes, yes. And they got it�they gave us the money for the tickets.
CE: Now, can I kind of stop and just ask, so how did you get in to see them? Because


wasn�t it really dangerous for you to go into that ghetto?
JR: There was no ghetto. It was�there was no wall.



CE: No wall, I know.


JR: It was just�


CE: I know. But still, to be seen, to be�were Germans�

JR: It was very early, you know. Of course we did not�the person would not realize that
we were Jews.

CE: Okay, right.

JR: By that time we�in Bodzentyn we used to have these yellow shields, you know. We
�

CE: You took those off?

JR: No, we didn�t�no, we right then and there, we posed as gentiles.

CE: Okay.

JR: So we knew where they lived, these friends of mine, and we got there. They gave us
the money, they gave us something to eat, and we went to the railway station. We had no
identification, absolutely none, neither as Jews or gentiles. We offered the tickets to the
conductor, which was�they were taking the tickets. We sat down. Of course, we spoke
Polish; we had no accents to worry about. And we sat there. The train started to move,
and we knew if there was some German or Polish conductor decided to question us, look
for some papers, we would be doomed. But we were lucky.

We got to Warsaw. We debarked the train, and we decided how to get into the ghetto. We
thought that was a problem, because there, of course, the ghetto was enclosed; it was in
1942. But we also had relatives�not relatives. Well, I told you that my mother was
adopted by some�by these people whom we called uncle and aunt, you know, although
they weren�t our blood relatives. And they were also well-to-do, because they were
owners of the factory. They had all kinds of money, I guess. And we knew that they were
already established as gentiles outside the Warsaw Ghetto.


We contacted them, they helped us with some money again, and then we found out how
to get into the ghetto. There were Jewish laborers that were working for German
industrial sites�factories�outside the ghetto. In order to get into the ghetto was to get�
to become members for a day or for two days with that working group so that you could
go inside the ghetto. And that�s how we did it.

I did it with one group. My sister, I think, went in first with one group, and then two,
three days later I got in. Of course, you had to pay some money to the leader of the group,
because at that time already in Warsaw, like in any other things, it was always bribing, it
was always things that were done underhandedly. This was the way of life. But we got
into the ghetto, and we finally met our father after two years.

CE: Can you talk�can you describe that? Can you describe meeting him?

JR: It was emotional, naturally. I don�t believe whether it was�whether my sister was
staying with him or not. I don�t think she was. She found some people from Plock that
were inside the ghetto. But I was closer to my father because I stayed with him, and it
was just a life, like it was before the war.

I did not consider myself a victim for some reason. I still had the mind of this prankster.
The whole world was just a joke. I was fast, I could run, I could do things that others
couldn�t do as a child in a ghetto and a child of the war. I guess I was just as any other
young person was contemptuous of adults. We held them in contempt because we knew
they could not�first of all, they could not provide for us. They could not offer the
protection that we were used to�I�m not talking about personally but by and large, okay.

So, I was in a ghetto, and I continued to do what other Jews did. They volunteered for
work outside of the ghetto, in order to�of course because they were paid a little bit for it,
but the biggest advantage to being part of this group [was] you could smuggle in things
out of the ghetto and back into the ghetto. So, if you were a successful smuggler, then it
was a nice job to have.

Because I was so small, wiry, and fast and all that, I got the reputation that I could be
depended on to smuggle things out�not necessarily as far as goods were concerned, but
errands�run errands. Mail letters, for example, outside the ghetto to relatives overseas,
and do things like that. And I�and also the Jewish fighting organization, which was
fledgling at that time, at least�it was becoming bigger and bigger�used me as a courier.
I was contacting people on the Aryan side and delivering all kinds of notes. Sometimes,


you know, I would just tell stories�tell them what they wanted to hear, what the
organization wanted them to hear. And that�s how I lived in the ghetto.

My sister, through the contacts that I had with these quasi-relatives of mine, she became
�she left the ghetto and as a gentile got a job and stayed outside of the ghetto for the rest
of the war�for the rest of the uprising in Warsaw�not the ghetto uprising, but the Polish
uprising. For a gentile�for a woman to live as an Aryan, as a Catholic, outside of the
ghetto was easier than for a man. Male Jews in the United�in Europe, 99.9 percent were
circumcised. And this was a giveaway, because if somebody suspected a Jew outside the
ghetto and he was a blackmailer�and there were quite a few of those, because there was
a whole new industry that developed, unfortunately, outside of the ghetto.

So for blackmailers, they called them szcmalcowniki. Shmalts in Jewish is fat, you know,
chicken schmaltz and all that. Well, smalec in Polish is fat, you know; it�s bacon and
things like that. And bacon during the war was worth its weight in gold. So they acquired
the name, these blackmailers, szcmalcowniki, because if they found you outside of the
ghetto�either give them something, they rob you, say okay. Well, most of them, they
didn�t care about you; they wanted to enrich themselves.

CE: Right.

JR: They could�well, some of them, of course, would do that and then, of course, say,
�Hey, there�s a Jew!� and that was it. But usually, they were�just wanted your money or
your valuables, whatever.

CE: And these were Polish citizens?

JR: Yeah.

CE: Non-Jewish Polish citizens?

JR: Yeah. And of course, I didn�t look Semitic. I was blond and my speech was unaccented
with Jewish language and all that, so I could pass as a gentile. The only thing
that I had to be very skillful�you know, in Warsaw, we were supposed to wear these
white armbands, and they had to be sewn in. Mine wasn�t, because the minute I got out of
this group, outside the ghetto with that working battalion, we called it, I would slip it off
and then mingle with the crowd that was surrounding us.


Now you ask, why the crowd? The crowd was surrounding us to barter for the things that
we were smuggling out of the ghetto, because in the ghetto after people were deported,
everything that they worked for all their lives, assembled, all their things�valuables�
were left, the German organized an outfit called Werterfassung, which something in
English would say like �acquisition of valuables,� or something, �registration of
valuables.� And they would come in and they load everything up. They would take
everything to the bare walls and would ship it to Germany. But we sometimes were faster
than they were, and we would get there first and we would steal anything we could. We
acquired another name, szabrowniki. Szaber is like a drywall, you know. Why were we
called szabrowniki? Because we would take everything, up to the bare wall. Okay?

CE: All right.

JR: And this is how the ghetto [was] really sustaining itself, because what we took out�
for example, Warsaw was very famous for millinery stores, factories and corsets,
women�s girdles and brassieres and so on. And that material that used to work for girdles
was like rubberized things, was�again, has its weight in gold. So whenever there was an
action�you know, deportation�we would see were the shops, you know, that were
making those girdles, because we knew the material was there. So we would cut up
whatever we could around ourselves, and outside of the�once we were out of the ghetto,
that bartering that�I call it the walking flea market�was starting. We would unravel our
things and we would give them that goods, and they would give us either money or
mostly foodstuff, you know; this was the thing. At the end of the day, we would smuggle
the foodstuff back to the thing.4

Now, this was all contingent on the sentries that were guarding the gates, because when I
say that we had these things on us and all that�sure, many times we could smuggle these
things out, but many times we were inspected. If you think that there is now inspection
when you go to the airport, you should see the inspection we had. And sometimes these
guards were not playing ball with us. As a matter of fact, we did not use the expression
�playing ball� back then, just �playing.�

We knew that the certain sentries, certain guards, we knew them by�not myself
personally, but the leaders of our battalion, work battalion, they knew who they were.
And they knew if they could be bribed or if they could be looking away, so that our
enterprise would be successful. But sometimes, right away they told us, �Those are killers
over there.� You know, such and such, �Don�t even attempt. You better take this thing and
throw it on the street, because not only they�ll take it away from you, but they�ll kill you
at the same time.� So we knew when the�we called it when the gate was playing, or
when it was not playing.

4 Interviewee clarifies: �Back to the Ghetto.�


CE: Were the sentries getting something out of this? They were getting part of the loot, or
�?

JR: Well, they were not supposed to. They were bribed sometimes, you know, because�
but as far as when they were confiscating things from us�it�s a very good thing that you
ask, because I forget about the very�often, some of the gates had a little�they built
little�not huts, little enclosures that they could�that the guards in wintertime, they
could go in and warm themselves up. So if they confiscated those things, they would put
it in those things, and then the German Werterfassung could come in and collect it
because it was a restric�we were stripped of it.

There was another thing. The guards were the German guards, usually two or three of
them. There were two�one Jewish policeman. Jewish policeman sounds very
impressive, but they were nothing; they were just helpers. Otherwise, if the German killer
didn�t want to get his hands dirty, he would tell the Jewish policeman, �Hey, inspect him,
take everything off him.� So this was their thing.

There were another people over there, Jewish people. They called them smieciarz. Smieci
is garbage; they were called the garbage man. They were the ones who were collect�
who were taking the things that were confiscated off us and put on wagons to be put
away. They were very, very rich people. The garbage men�economically speaking, they
were Brahmans; this was the upper caste of the Jewish people, because they stole some of
the things. And to be a smieciarz at the gate�oh, it was just like being an aide to the
president of the United States. It was just fabulous.

CE: And how did you get that position?

JR: Oh, no, I wasn�t.

CE: But how did one get that position?

JR: Well, I guess it�s a matter of luck or something, but you know, it was hard work and
all that. But smieciarz, oh, they were just�

The other people who were also very rich were the owners of the funeral homes, because
they were for a time�for a long time, people who died had to be collected and go to the


cemetery. Cemetery was outside of the ghetto. And this owner of this�one owner of the
house, Pinker Funeral Home, they had the permission to go out of the ghetto to bury
people in the Jewish cemetery. Now, you can imagine if one had a permission to go with
the hearse, or sometimes with just with anything with corpses, things could be smuggled
under that, too.

CE: Right, right.

JR: So he was thought to be millionaire. Of course the money didn�t mean didn�t mean
anything, but he was very rich. So they knew that Pinker was�his name was Pinker; he
was the most rich�the richest person in ghetto, plus the smieciarz, the garbage men. So,
I don�t know where I was�but I was talking about�oh, yeah. So we were�I was going
in and out of the ghetto�

Pause in recording

JR: One of my functions was, once I was out of the ghetto and we came already to the
industrial side, I was�the one that I was most frequently going to was on a main railroad
in Warsaw, not on a passenger area but the commercial things, where unloading things,
loading things. But my function, of course, was not for me to work, it�s to tear myself
away. If I didn�t tear myself away right away from that wildest turmoil that was going
with that flea market�sometimes I just tore myself away and right�I didn�t even go to
the work site. Sometimes I was spotted that I was�somebody noticed that I was pulling
this thing [armband] away from me, that I was really�

CE: That you were taking the band off?

JR: Right, and some of these szcmalcowniki, these people, these blackmailers�they had,
you know, hawk eyes; they knew exactly what was going on. And on one or two
occasions, I thought I was safe and they approached me. On certain occasions, I gave him
the few things that I had and they let me go. One time somebody spotted me, and I start
running away and he says, �Hey, there�s a Jew over there!� And right away there was
three or four guys, because there were more than one. You know, there�s very unfortunate
things, because as I say, anti-Semitism was great. Warsaw�there was a war going on,
people needed money. The combination of two made these blackmailers, you know, very
active.

And remember that I told you that my training track and field helped? I started to run. I
almost kept�I kept well ahead of them, but they were almost coming closer to me, and


they were yelling, �There�s a Jew running! Jew running!� And I kept saying the same
thing. �There is a Jew over there!�

CE: Oh, that�s wonderful!

JR: And I slowed down a little bit, and some of them, as they ran past me, say, �Where,
where, where?� I say, �There right around the corner.� (laughs)

CE: (laughs) Oh, that�s wonderful!

JR: Yeah, I was very slick.

CE: Wow. Wow.

JR: But then of course�but if I didn�t have an assignment to turn myself right away and
went to the workplace to this�let�s see, the main railroad�people used to give me
money, and I would again leave that workplace. Again, the leaders, both the Germans and
the Poles and the Jews, had to be bribed�not by me, but the people who collected money
to bribe them so that Jerry Rawicki could go out and go to the marketplace, buy whatever
I had to buy and bring them back. That�s what I was doing.

There was one time that I was not very successful, and I was spotted by some of these
blackmailers. I had everything loaded up on a rickshaw to take back to this railroad
station, and I was spotted. Two guys came over, and they said to me, �Hey, Jew, you get
off.� And they took everything away and I was left there.

Worse even than that, somebody else saw me, saw this whole situation while the other
guys rode away with that rickshaw. And now they came�another guy came up and says,
�Okay, Jew, let�s go.� And he was a big�of course, I was very tiny. I was small; he was a
big guy.

And he took me to a house, to a building right around the marketplace, and we went all
the way to the attic and he says to me, �Take off your pants.� Because usually things were
hidden, you know�I didn�t have anything on me because all the money that these people
gave me I already spent, you know. But I had sewn in my underwear the number of the
telephone of my sister.


I was hoping that he would take whatever I had, which I didn�t have much�I might have
some change maybe. I give it to him and I said, �That�s all I have.� And I thought this
was it. And then I see two other guys coming, and I say, �Oh, this will be bad.� Well, I
thought this was the end of my�because one guy, you know, I could probably get away
from him, but with two others? Well, it just happened to be [that] the two others were sent
by somebody who saw what happened to me, and they sent them to rescue me.

CE: Wow.

JR: Well, they approached this other guy, and he was starting to say something. I don�t
know [what], but probably said, �Hey, this is my guy.� And they started to pummel him.
They almost killed him. And they said, �Get dressed and get out of here.�

CE: So were they from the ghetto?

JR: No, that was outside the ghetto; this was in the marketplace.

CE: So who were the two people who helped?

JR: Well, this must have been the guy that I used to buy from. He never told me that he
knew, but he must have seen how they took away everything I had on the rickshaw and
they�he must have seen the other guy lead me away and he ended up, too.5 But this
wasn�t the end of it. When I got back finally to the workplace and I told them about it,
they didn�t believe me.

CE: They didn�t.

JR: That was part of life. Everybody was suspicious of everybody. I told them the
situation, they said, �Oh, no!� They demanded the money back because they thought I
took the money.

CE: And what happened?

5 Interviewee added after the oral history interview: �I figured out I was in trouble.�


JR: Well, I never dared anymore to go to the marketplace. It was the biggest marketplace
in Warsaw; it�s called the Iron Gate. And then, of course, they wouldn�t probably trust me
with the money anyhow, but that�s what it was. This was a very, very traumatic day for
me.

But the thing that bothered me most that I thought, �Oh, my God!� I was going to give
him the [phone] number if he�I don�t know. Of course, he couldn�t possibly think of this
thing being sewn into my underwear, but this�the whole time that he was trying to get�
had me undressed and all that, all I was thinking that if he kills me, he kills me, but I
hope that he never discovers what I had.

So, and that was a�as a matter of fact, after that I changed my workplace. I never went
back. Maybe once or twice I went back to the railroad station, and then I decided to go
somewhere else. So�

CE: Now, what was your father doing all this time?

JR: My father was�I was just about to�before you mentioned I was going to tell you
another thing that I was�it�s very difficult for me to say, it�s almost like�

My father�well, my father was working for a tremendous�for a big German factory,
T�bbens. There were two factories in the ghetto; one was T�bbens, one was Schultz. One
was making uniforms for the army; they were�hats, among other things, so they called
them the hat makers. The other one was making things for cleanings�you know, soaps
and brushes and all that; they called them the brush makers.

My father was working for T�bbens; he was a hat maker. And to get a job at T�bbens�or
Schultz, for that matter�was a plum job, because after all, they were making things for
the German army. German army was at war, they needed the uniforms, so it was�I was
telling you about the smieciarz, the garbage men. Next to garbage men was to get a job at
T�bbens. So, my father was working there.

At one point�of course, throughout the Holocaust the German brutality and the
unspeakable cruelty always went hand in hand with deception. They didn�t have to do
that, because we were just like putty in their hand. They could do anything with us. We
were completely�we were hopeless, we were helpless, we were unable to resist, but they
used the deception.


Just before the ghetto was attacked by the Germans the word got around, and my father
told me himself that T�bbens decided that the factory in the ghetto�it was scattered;
they had two plans in two different areas, different streets. That wasn�t very efficient, and
they are going to be resettled to another place�you know, outside of Warsaw�where
they were promised all kinds of things: better housing, better this, better other things,
better wages, which�what they called wages. They were all taken there and machine
gunned. It was just�we didn�t know at that time that in�around Passover they were
going to attack the ghetto to demolish it and to destroy it completely, but they figured,
you know, well, maybe there�ll be fewer people to kill, so let�s get these T�bbens people
machine gunned first.

But then you asked me about�this was, of course, how my father lost his life.
Somewhere in fall or early winter in 1942, I was standing with my father. It was�again,
I don�t know why. It was drizzly, terrible, cold, running rainy day, rain with snow mixed.
And we [were] waiting, Father and myself, to cross the street. It was a main street in the
ghetto, Zamenhofa Street. And a hansom cab goes by, one of those enclosed Droschkes,
you know. And my father waved, and I said, �What happened?�

I did not�it was raining and there was�there might have been something behind that
glass window of that hansom cab, but I didn�t know anybody who was there. And I ask
my father, �Who was that?� And he mentioned a name of a guy who�my father worked
before the war with his sister, and he mentioned the name, and I said to him, �What�s he
doing?� I asked him�no, I didn�t ask him what he was doing. I asked him, my father,
�What�s his name?� And he mentioned the name, and as an afterthought, he says, �Oh, he
is a leader of a group that works outside of the ghetto.�

One day I was on an assignment, and it took me some long time and I couldn�t get to in
time for the working group to join them and to go back to the ghetto. So I was faced with
just�not able to get into the ghetto, because you just couldn�t go in as an individual. So,
I took a streetcar, and I walked and all that. I got close to the ghetto and I saw different
work groups coming in. There was about two groups were delayed because the gate was
not playing, so there was all kinds of problems there. So, I just went into a building over
there, and I said, �I�ll wait until maybe things quiet down a little bit.� It got so cold that I
couldn�t possibly stand any longer. I couldn�t see because, you know, my eyelids were
almost closed and all that. I was in stupor, because I must have fallen asleep or
something.

Everybody was�everyone went through already by the time I woke up. It was late, and
the whole area to the next to the ghetto�entrance to the ghetto was a big plaza, and it
was lit like it was a sports event. And finally I saw somebody walking�saw something.
Another group was coming in. So I regained consciousness, and I went out and I joined
the group. The people, when they saw me I looked like a, you know�I was all with snow


and all that. They knew that I can endanger them, because if the manifest in the morning
showing X number of people going out, [there] has to be the same number of people�

CE: Right.

JR: And they could have only also known�I don�t know. These people know that the
gate was not playing that night. So they started to yell and scream to �Get him out! He�s a
danger!� And some of them say, �Quiet!� Some said, �Let it go, because they�ll hear from
there.� You know, we were quite�little bit away from the gate, from the entrance. But
they were kicking me and telling me, pushing me out and this and the other.

Finally, the leader of the group got a hold of the commotion, and he was at the front of
the group. He comes back, and they were yelling to him, �This guy came in. He�s going
to get us killed!� And I�the guy, the leader of the group, grabs me by the arm, ready to
pull me out. And I said my name. He could have been�name didn�t mean to anybody.
He could have been�anyhow, he was the man who knew my father in that hansom cab.
Because when he grabbed me by the arm�by my shoulder�and just right [as] he pulled
me out I say, �I�m Jerzy Rawicki,� you know. And I�

CE: And he left you.

JR: He�his hand�I saw him release his hand, and he pushed me back. He went to the
front of the group, and I went through.

CE: And you didn�t get�no one got into trouble for that? Lot of close calls.

JR: How�why would I say my name? Because there were hundred thousand people in
the ghetto, but many of them were leaders of the group. I could have said the normal
thing for me to say, �Please don�t take me out.� But all I did was mention my name.

CE: And you don�t know why you said your name?

JR: Once we got inside the ghetto, I wasn�t even going to make an issue out of it, because
I thought maybe he�s going to ask some money of me or something. He asked me, he
says, �Are you Abraham�s son?�


CE: Wow.

JR: So these were the things that were, I think, supernatural, because I still cannot
remember why I said that. And that didn�t only happen only to me; other people that I
know had�not similar, but also these supernatural�out of the almost body experiences.
My own sister had that. She doesn�t like to talk about it, but I just found something
recently about it that was just unbelievable.

She�this may be something. Of course it doesn�t�I may have mentioned it to you
because it�s very significant, too, because I say about the anti-Semitism, about the�you
know, these blackmailers, such a cruel people. But here�s another story.

My sister was, as I told you, working as a gentile in this coffee shop. And that coffee shop
had a telephone that you could�use a telephone and then pay the person at the counter,
you know. And she was at the counter one time. There was nobody other�sometimes she
had a helper, but she was by herself. And two girls come in to use the phone. And she
noticed�I just�she just told me the story a couple of months ago�and she noticed they
were her girlfriends. One of them was from her class, and the other one was (�).6 And
she [JR�s sister] almost died, because she had false papers and all that.

And they used the phone, and one of them comes in and she looks at her. And my sister
says, �Please don�t tell anybody.� So she paid for the telephone, and she walked out with
her sister. My sister was already well established in this place; she was making money,
she was living in the same with�her bosses had a house over there; she lived in her
house. And she was�her life was made for the�

(phone rings) Is this mine or yours? Okay�

CE: That�s my phone. It will stop.

JR: That�s all right, let it ring.

CE: It�ll stop in a second.

JR: Yeah. So, she did know what to do. She said to me�she said, �Well�� She had a
terrible nightmare that day�that night. She didn�t know what to do. She had a decision

6 Interviewee clarifies: �The other one was one grade higher.�


to make, because this�the girl could have gone out and say, �Listen, there�s a Jewish girl
�my friend, my school friend�living in there,� and that would have been it. But she
didn�t. She [JR�s sister] kept working until the end of the war.

At the end of the war, my sister decided to go back to our town and look up the girl and
thank her for saving her life. So, she gets to the house�she found out where they live,
and one of the sisters opens the door and she says, �What can I do for you?� And she
recognized her [JR�s sister] and said, �Oh, yes, you are Felicia?� And I say�and so my
sister asked, �So, where�s your sister?� �Oh, she�s out of town.� So, she [the other girl]
asked her, �What did you come here for?� So my sister told her, �Well, I was going to
thank her for saving my life, because you remember you were in a telephone�you were
making a telephone [call] in Warsaw and all that? And she recognized me, and I wanted
to thank her for not letting anybody know.� [The other girl replied] �You know what? I
never knew.7 She never told me about it.�

CE: Wow! Wow!

JR: That shows you that people�now, to her, it was an act of heroism, because she
couldn�t even trust her own sib�not that she didn�t trust her, but she made a pledge to
herself not to say it to anybody, because never knows. Maybe the other one�maybe her
sister will say it in her sleep or something. I think this, of course, puts in balance, in
perspective, that some people were really heroes, while some were scoundrels. And this, I
think�I was going to say it as a complete different attitude of some people. Here were
the people who were trying to blackmail people and the thrill of killing them, and here
was a woman that was quite noble. So�

CE: Mm-hm. This is a good place to stop, I think, and take another break.

JR: Okay.

CE: Okay.

JR: I thought that I would tell you that because I think this is�to me, when I heard it
from my sister I think this is very poignant, you know? It was small things, but I�m
always�I�m wondering whether I�m too harsh on those blackmailers or those people that
were such, you know, dyed-in-wool anti-Semites; they would do anything. And maybe
I�m just prejudiced, you know, so whenever I find something that I can attenuate this
thing, I always say that�especially I, who was saved by a gentile.

7 Interviewee clarifies: �She said, �I never knew that my sister recognized you.��


So something I say to myself, �Well, maybe I should be really extolling the virtue of
people that helped Jews, rather than even mention those,� because the thing is this:
unfortunately, the majority of people were against the Jews. Of course not�some were
inactive, but the attitude towards the Jews was very, very negative in Poland. In other
countries�

Part 2 ends; part 3 begins

CE: Okay, this is tape three on July 1, 2009, interview with Jerry Rawicki.

So, Jerry, I thought we would start with you�you�re in the Warsaw ghetto with your
father, and to go back and talk about what happens to your mother and your sister, and
then move and talk about anything else that you would like to talk about in the ghetto.

JR: Okay. Well, when my sister and I�older sister and I left Bodzentyn for Warsaw�I
think I mentioned to you that we were hoping once my [other] sister is going to be
capable of traveling, we�d try to make arrangements for my mother and for the sick sister
to join us in Warsaw. But we found out many, many, many�as a matter of fact, possibly
after the war, we found out that at the same time�just after we left, two or three days
later, all the Jews were rounded up in this little town and they were taken to Treblinka
and gassed over there�killed over there. So�

CE: But you did not know this while you were in Warsaw?

JR: No. No, we did not. The communication with this little town, Bodzentyn, was very,
very difficult, so we did not�though we were still hoping that they live in this little town
in Bodzentyn just like we do in Warsaw. But that wasn�t to be like that.

At that time, the news of what is happening to us, to Jews, was trickling in. You have to
understand that we had no access to newspapers. Of course, there was no television. We
were not allowed to have radios�of course, the underground had some radios, but it
wasn�t for regular broadcast. So we didn�t know what was really happening. We�re
constantly deceived by the Germans.

When we were being deported, from the very beginning of the occupation until the very
end, the brutality was always accompanied by these false hopes that our�that we would
be�our lot will be improved when they move us, when they resettle us somewhere.


Because they always had an excuse: the war was going on for strategic purposes; that we
were of course not trustworthy citizens, to say the least, so that�s why it is necessary for
them to resettle us. For a long, long time, we didn�t know that the end of these trains that
were supposed to take us to �better places,� quote unquote, were gas chambers and
extermination camps.

But by grapevine�which was very, very good during the war in Warsaw Ghetto�we
were learning of the truth. And the resistance forces, which were growing but growing
very slowly, because we had no means of obtaining weapons. There were Polish
underground organization outside the Warsaw [Ghetto], and they were better weaponized
then we did, much better. So, whatever we could acquire outside of the ghetto in way of
arms, we tried to get it, but it was very difficult.

To smuggle something�to attempt to smuggle something through the gates was suicidal,
because if they found out as much as a little gunpowder in somebody�s pocket, the whole
group would be killed. Occasionally, when the sentry was bribed�when was playing, as
I mentioned to you before�some small weapons could be smuggled through, but that
was about it. Through the sewers, some machineguns were sometimes smuggled through,
but that was very, very miniscule as compared to the firepower to the Germans had. You
have to understand that there was a German army that almost conquered the whole world.
They would pass Stalingrad. They were at the gates of Leningrad and Moscow. And here
was a group of citizens who had sidearms, a few Molotov cocktails, few grenades, and
we were supposed to defend ourselves against the onslaught of German army.

But it got to a point where we knew we either resist or perish. So the effort to arm
ourselves gained momentum, and by the time January came, 1943�when the Germans
planned on eliminating the ghetto in January 1943, there was resistance. Not as much a
fighting resistance as refusal to get out of the houses, load�entered the�allowed to�
allowed ourselves to be taken to those Umschlagplatz, the railroad siding that was to be
taking us�that was to take us to the extermination places.

The Germans were really caught by surprise, because they expected fully well that being
so successful�you know, piece by piece to eliminate, to make the�to diminish and kill
the inhabitants of the ghetto for so many years, they figured that now we�re weakened
enough that we�ll just completely surrender. Not only that we are weakened, you know,
as far as fighting is concerned, but that our psyche, that our will to live, doesn�t exist
anymore. So, when they decided that we would just not�then they found that we [were]
just not coming out of the houses and surrender, so to speak, they were surprised, and
they gave up. We thought we scored a tremendous victory. We were euphoric about it,
and we thought, �Well, things will happen differently now. We showed them!�


But this was just a pyrrhic victory, because what happened? They just changed their
plans. They decided that they will try it again. We didn�t know that at that time, but they
regrouped and they attacked Warsaw Ghetto on a Passover night�eve of Passover in
April. And it was very uneven fight, to say the least.

I was in the ghetto on the day that that happened, because I was�the day before, I was
on an assignment outside the ghetto. And I could have stayed out another day, because
my assignment called for me to be out for the following day, too, but I was enticed by
some people that I knew to come in for the Passover Seder, for the meal Passover eve,
which I did. And the following morning, I was hoping that I would go out with another
group again.

But it wasn�t meant to be, because right after midnight we noticed that the ghetto was
surrounded by artillery, by machineguns, by armored vehicles, flamethrowers, and the
assault happened. They did not even ask anymore. They were not even inside the ghetto
asking us to come out. It was just firepower.

As I said before, we had very little to fight this overwhelming force. There were some
instances�many instances�of heroism that is even difficult to imagine. People with
sidearms were attacking tanks. It was suicidal. They knew that they [were] not going to
be able to accomplish much, but it was just a matter of dying with honor. So, that�s what
happened. The resistance lasted for about�for all practical purposes, for about a week to
ten days; after that there were just sporadic skirmishes. The Germans were incinerating
house by house, building by building.

Those of us who were left without any ammunition, any weapons, decided to hide until
we can possibly get out of the ghetto. I and two other young men were hiding for many,
many days�possibly weeks�in a cellar there, in which the previous owners stored
potatoes and apples. It was possibly somebody that had a vegetable store, or something.
Everything was fermented. The apples were fermented to where they just were like
alcohol, but the potatoes were liquefied, so we used it for drinking as well for eating, just
a little bit. At night we tried at least�all of us, three of us at the beginning�to go out
and to find a way. Maybe there was a wall that we could easily scale, or may[be] a wall
that was probably damaged by the artillery barrage. But it was many, many times�many
days that we tried, possibly weeks that we tried.

Finally, I was left alone in that cellar. The other two guys disappeared. I don�t know what
happened to them. One day, I must have been disoriented. Not knowing what I was
doing, I got out of the cellar during the day, and I was caught by a patrol that was looking
for wretches like me that were hiding and coming out�you know, like rats, to find a way


to get out. And we were being led to the Umschlagplatz; there was maybe fifteen or
twenty of us in the group.

We were escorted by the auxiliary police, or army, that Germans used to use in the ghetto.
They were made of Latvians or Ukrainians; they were not Germans. And as they were
leading us�we were already within maybe hundred, two hundred yards from the
Umschlagplatz, from which there would be�would have been no way to [escape], you
know�somebody, possibly outside of the ghetto from the building over there, shoots; a
shot rang out. Our escorts fell to the ground, because there were some German tanks and
artillery still in the ghetto. The ghetto was already, you know, demolished, smoldering
ruins. And they started to fire at this house from which the shot came out.

Our escorts fell to the ground. Everybody else fell to the ground, except me. I ran back to
the ghetto, and I hid in the rubble of building. I was there for a long, long time, at night�
already it was; I saw those beautiful night sky and the moon. And the rats were nibbling
at me, and I got up and I was trying to again look at the wall. I knew where the wall was
because it was near the ghetto, near the Umschlagplatz, which I knew the surroundings.

There was another guy�I�m sorry, two other guys�that I met over there. One of them
had a grenade. And I saw that they spotted a few bricks missing in a wall. They threw the
grenade. There was a big bang, tremendous explosion of it. We ran away, but�they ran
away. I came back, and the hole was not changed. It was just too little, two or three
bricks.

I decided to take a chance. Throughout this ordeal when I was in that cellar, I had a shirt
with me, a clean shirt. I had a string around it, because I knew if I had to get out and see
my sister�this was my incentive because I knew that she knew that I was in the ghetto.
All I was thinking about [was] going and meet her, to tell her that I am alive. So I had
this, and I saved this shirt like it was my greatest possession, because I knew if I don�t�
if I get out in rags like this, I�ll be caught right away.

So I put this�my hand with this shirt first, and I squeezed myself through it. How, I
don�t know. I�m�I don�t know whether I�m claustrophobic now or I got claustrophobic
before that. I still see that opening in the wall. I was small, of course, naturally I am, but I
don�t know how it was possible to get through these maybe four bricks, regular four
bricks. How can a man go through that?

On the other side of the wall was a railroad station, another railroad station. Not the one I
used to work before; this was a commercial railroad station. It was already almost dawn,
and there was a German hospital train parked over there; it was bringing German


wounded soldiers from the Russian front. The train was besieged�well, not besieged,
but there was all kinds of hobos, winos. People were asking for cigarettes and things like
that.

I noticed there was a pump at the station. I took my shirt off, whatever the rag was, and I
threw it away. I washed myself up a little bit. I put clean shirt [on]. I went to the�
towards the train. There was a young guy�I still see his face now�in pajamas, blue
pajamas, and I asked him for something to eat. I knew�by then I knew enough German.
I said, �Etwas zu essen? Something to eat?� And he gave me a canteen with macaroni and
cheese. I had my first meal in weeks, courtesy of the German army. And after I had this
meal�I gobbled it up; I made sure that I (laughs) didn�t look too anxious to eat�I went
back, and I was very nonchalant about it. I went back to this guy who saw me swallow it
and all that, and I said to him, �Danke sch�n,� you know, �thank you very much.� And I
left to see my sister.

I didn�t have any money, and I was very weakened by then because I also had a
tremendous�a very terrible skin affliction, scabies. It was so bad that my�things were
bleeding. My finger�here in between fingers my skin was completely raw. So I had to
conceal my fingers, my hands, and it was difficult, because how did I travel? I jumped on
a streetcar. I didn�t have any money. I stand on the edge of the streetcar, and if the
conductor came to say, �What are you doing?� I would jump off and wait for another
streetcar. That�s how I got�that�s how urgent, you know, and Warsaw during the game�
during the war use transportation, and I was adept at it.

When I came to my daughter�s place�

CE: Your sister�s?

JR: My sister�s, I�m sorry. She saw�she thought I was an apparition, because she
thought it was�I was dead. Where she worked as the crow flies was about maybe two
miles from the ghetto. At night, they all would get on top of the roof�on top of the
building, on the roof�and see the spectacle of the ghetto burning. Many people, of
course, were mortified by it, but there [were] some people who were making jokes, and
she had to go along with the jokes.

For some time, of course, when she first saw me, she was speechless. Naturally, she just
told me to sit down, and treat me just like as a customer, gave me a breakfast. Although I
had breakfast already, I ate again. And for some time I would come to her place, and she
would treat me as a customer and feed me. She would give me some money so that I
sometimes would pay her for the meal.


But it was getting to a point where I was afraid I was endangering her, because I was just
too frequent of a visitor, and at that time, everybody was suspicious. The air of death was
everywhere, and I was afraid that I was a messenger of it, that people�I would always
ask, �Do people look at me?� Of course by that time, you know, she gave me some
money so I got better clothing, outside of the shirt. (coughs) And�

CE: Where were you sleeping?

JR: Everywhere.

CE: Everywhere.

JR: Yeah, there was�the place that she worked was a very nice part of Warsaw, Zoliborz.
It was a middle/upper middle class neighborhood, and there were very nice buildings.
Sometimes I would go all the way up to the upper floor�up all the way to the attic; some
attics were open, and I knew which were open and I slept over there. Some of them�
sometimes I slept in those gazebos; they were little places where people could sit during
the day. Different derelicts would sleep over there.

You would not believe it, but I would get some alcohol�it was moonshine. I would drink
it, or just wash my mouth with it so I would smell with alcohol, and I would sleep there,
so that if I was ever spotted�and I was not; of course I always�I was circumcised. I
always was�if somebody decided to examine me, they would find I was a Jew, but I
could always say that I was faking drunkenness, and I could do it very well. I could
stagger and all that as a young kid.

So there was some tricks, you know, that I had to use. There was also�oh, yeah. There
were�you know, when I was a courier, I sometimes�not very often�I would go to a
very, very upper class neighborhood in Warsaw, near the theater plaza, to contact some
people from Polish underground. And I was desperate, and one time I decided I�ll go and
see them, because they knew who I was, and I would ask him maybe to help me, because
I was afraid I was endangering my sister. I don�t know how they would help me.
Somewhere in the back of my mind I thought maybe ask them to hide me.

So I went over there, and they were gone. Whether they�they were also in the
underground�whether they were arrested, killed, whatever. The same day I came back,
and I thought, Oh, there�s something. I saw a man that I saw before, and I suspected that


he was Jew. He looked very, very elegant. He had the three-piece suit with the vest and
all that, with the tie, and I can still see that suit; it was like a very expensive suit. And I
was trying to make eye contact with him, but he didn�t respond, so I figured he was a
Jew. But I figured�well.

The following day, I think, or maybe two days later, I was sleeping somewhere�I don�t
remember where�and I was (coughs) coming to my sister for breakfast. And I saw on
one of the lawns�there was very much greenery, because it was a very nice
neighborhood�there was a group of people standing over something. And I went over,
and I saw him lying. His face was completely covered with ants. I couldn�t see his face,
but I recognized his suit and all that. So I was very much upset about it, and I just didn�t
have any appetite to eat or anything like that. And this was very unusual, you know, at
that time.

So, instead of going to my sister, I got to a telephone, and I phoned [her]. I say, �I�m not
coming over today,� because I didn�t want her to worry. And I decided to take a streetcar
to go somewhere, and the streetcar took me to a place near a beach. So, I figure I�ll go to
the beach. I went to the beach, and I saw three guys sitting on the sand over there. They
were fully dressed, you know�most of the people were at that beach, but some were in a
swimming outfit. But they were sitting over there.

So I approached them, and I just introduced myself. I told them�they were playing
hooky, they were hooky. They were from an under�they were going to�attending an
underground school, but they decided to play hooky. So I told them I was going to do the
same, and we clicked and we talked�they were about my age�talked about the girls,
you know, conquests, and how they made out, this. So, I added my fantasies to it and all
that.

And everything was fine, while I was afraid. There were many jokes around�Jewish�of
the Jews of that time, and I don�t know how I can keep my composure if the subject of
Jews, you know, because the ghetto was already burned�burning and all that. Jews were
on everybody�s mind over there outside of the ghetto. But nothing like this happened.
They had some food, which they shared with me, because I told them I got in an
argument with my mother and I didn�t want her food.

Well, we had good time for about two or three hours, exchange jokes, stories, this and the
other thing. And the two of the guys left, and one of the�I was left with this other guy,
and we talked again. And the talk was a little bit different, because we were joking. He
asked me about things and I was inventing stories, you know, about where I was from.


And then, finally, he says to me, �Well, let�s go home.� And he got up, he collected his
things, and he says, �Well, let�s go home.� And I was just sitting in the sand, and I was
just playing with the sand and didn�t answer it. So he asked it once again, and then when
I didn�t answer he was sort of annoyed, says, �Damn it, are you deaf?�

And then, when I looked up at him, I say, �I�m a Jew.�

And I expect him�you know, as I mentioned to you, that the air was the anti-Semitist,
the hatred. It was so�the air was so tense. For me to say, �I�m a Jew� to a stranger�and
there was some people still on the beach. All he had to say, �Hey, there�s a Jew here.�
And that would be�there would be probably somebody over there that would have
[been] very, very happy to take me to the police station, or if it happened to be a German
maybe kill me right then and there. It was unheard of. It was just�imagine that there is
somebody right now, the most wanted person�on a most wanted list, and he spots an

F.B.I. agent and he knows it and he says, �I am the one.� You know, that�s what it was.
And I expected him to yell, �Oh, there�s a Jew here!� And he bent down, and he says,
�Mother of God! Mother of God, what are you doing here?� And he took me home. He
told me we weren�t talking on the way back at all. He paid for the streetcar, although I
had some money. (coughs) The only thing that he told me, he says, �My parents are out
of work. I can tell my mother, but I don�t think how my father will [like the] idea. I�ll
take you home and see if we can help you.� That�s all that was said.

But they lived in one of those nice new houses, you know, in this nice neighborhood. And
they had a�in the cellar�in a lower level over there, they had like a shack, you know,
like a cellar. And he said to me, �Go ahead. I�ll put you over there, and when my mother
comes in, I�ll see how we can help you.� When I saw�I heard him [lock] the padlock on
the other side, I almost died, because I was badly claustrophobic, and I thought, Well,
[this is] the day I committed suicide.

But as night came, and I saw the padlock unlock. It was already dark. And he brought two
pillows and something�buttermilk�and he says, �You can stay here. But you cannot
come upstairs, because we don�t know how my father�s going to react.�

So, again I slept overnight. He came in, he unlocked the padlock, again he brought
something to eat. I had�I took this with me, without ever saying anything. I was ready to
leave, because I felt confined again, you know. Who knows, maybe he has something in
mind; maybe tomorrow he�ll have the accomplice, you know. And he looked at me, and I
took the couple�there were two or four steps outside, and I was at the third step. I was


already on an even level. And I was going to say goodbye or something, but in the same
�at the�instead of that, I say, �Can I come back?� And they kept me like this.

I never told him that where he kept me, I was in walking distance from my sister. As a
matter of fact, when I left that morning after I asked him if I can come back, the first
thing I went to my sister and tell her that I�m alive, you know. Whatever he gave me to
eat, I ate it at her (�).8 All she gave me was something to drink. I never told them about
that, and that bothered me all my life.

CE: You never told him about your sister?

JR: No. It bothered me that I didn�t trust him. After the war, I was trying to find things
about him. I went to Warsaw. The building was demolished because there was fight over
there, you know; the Polish people up�rose up in August of 1944. I made some contact
with Red Cross, and they couldn�t find anything. The communication was very, very
sparse, you know, at that time.

I came to the United States and one [night], maybe twenty years ago�I was already in
this country probably twenty, thirty years�I had a dream. I dreamt about this young�
some young fellow, and I thought well, maybe I will resume my search for him. I did.
And somebody told me that there was a Polish historian by the name [Regina]
Domanska. She was publishing [at] the Holy Cross University�I think she was a
professor at Holy Cross University. She was a historian, and she was chronicling the
Warsaw ghetto�Warsaw underground.

I got a hold of the book, and there was a listing that Janusz Rybakiewicz was hung.9
Where was he hung? He was hung from the balcony of a building that was still standing
in the Warsaw Ghetto, across the street from the Polish Supreme Court on such and such
street. That might have been the building that I stayed in, because when I was in the
ghetto, especially that night that I came in for the Passover meal, it was right across the
street from the building of the Supreme Court.

Then, of course, I started a campaign to have him�because I thought he was just a�he
was just�when he was young, he was seven�eighteen years old. For an adult to show
this much compassion for a man, for another young man, for a Jew who escaped the
ghetto, was one thing�and many did�but he was just a young kid. So, I started to�I

8 Interviewee clarifies: �I ate it at her place of work.�
9 JR is probably referring to Domanska�s book Pawiak: wiezienie Gestapo 1939-1944 (Pawiak Gestapo
Prison, 1939-1944), which contains a list of names of Polish prisoners who were deported to Auschwitz
from the Pawiak prison in Warsaw.



petitioned at Yad Vashem. I heard that they were seeking people like that, who were
helping at the risk of their own life to save Jews, and I felt that he fit that role supremely
well. But it was so many thing that I had to do, you know; they were so�it was�and the
title of this thing was�these people who awarded this honor was Righteous Among the
Nations. And to be declared Righteous Among the Nations, you had to undergo the same
scrutiny if you applied for a Nobel Prize.

So just two years ago, I, after many, many, many years�I almost gave it up again, but I
went to Israel four years ago. I went to the Yad Yashem, and again, a coincidence. There
was a receptionist that I thought she would be just another person, impersonal thing. I
was going to ask her, �Listen, I have applied for such and such thing. What�s happening
with it?� Guess what? She was a survivor.

CE: Was what?

JR: A survivor.

CE: Oh, mm-hm.

JR: So she helped me. I told her the story, and two years later it came to fruition. So,
sometimes I am considered a hero, a person who survived because of certain things. To
me, some of the things that made me survive, that helped me to survive, were almost
impossible things to�I sometimes talk about these things, and I ask myself, �Was that
possible? Did it really happen?� And I think this is so�in the some of these things, I feel
�one of these�every little episode that I talk about maybe doesn�t mean much. But
some of these things, I think, describe the tragedies, the quintessence of the Holocaust
and what people went through.

It is almost impossible, no matter how exhaustive an interview or a book or an essay, to
sometimes express the feelings that one has about this things, because how does�as
impossible and improbable [as] these things were, it is almost impossible to describe. The
cruelty was design�by the Germans was designed. They could have done all these things
to us in a less cruel way, but you know why they didn�t? Because they knew they could
only get away with it if people (�).10 The normal human being says, �That�s impossible.�
And that�s what happened.

10 Interviewee clarifies: �They could only get away with it if people could not believe such cruelty was
possible.�


Of course, I�m not about to absolve people who haven�t helped us in any significant way
to survive. But it�s natural. I don�t know, if somebody told me sixty years ago that they
are burning�that they are gassing people, men, women, children�I mean, for a human
being, for a normal human being, it was difficult to take. And they knew that. And they
say the more impossible, the more egregious, the more cruel, the more inhumane, they�ll
do it. Fewer people will believe it. And that�s�

CE: So, how long were you with this�in this basement, or this cellar?

JR: I can�t tell�during the ghetto, or when he�s�

CE: No, with�when he�with this�

JR: I would say�

CE: �with this young man.

JR: I would say it was anywhere between four and six weeks, something like that.

CE: Four to six weeks.

JR: I would, and�oh, I mentioned to you that two�well, one thing bothered me all my
life, because I never told�I never, because I have�I would have told him, look, it�ll be
much less strain on him. �Look, I have a sister here; you don�t have to feed me.� I�m
here, you know. (coughs) So I didn�t say that, because you know this thing that I had in
that�when they caught me and I had that telephone [number]? I was so protective of
this, I figured�oh.

So, and another thing that bothered me that I never�he never knew what happened to
me.

Pause in recording

JR: There was another thing that happened. After the war, after the ghetto was
demolished, a rumor spread again. Lo and behold, the Germans declared an amnesty on


every Jew that was hiding or was hidden by whoever outside of the ghetto. �Let�s
bygones be bygones. Whatever happened, fine.� But those who survived are lucky,
because they made a deal with South American countries that were holding German
prisoners of war, that they need to repatriate these German prisoners of war, and the only
way that the South American countries will agree to the deal [is] if they will be
exchanged for the Jews. So let the Jews come out, register in this particular hotel�the
name of this was Polish Hotel on Dluga Street�and that�s it, and they will be exchanged.

When I heard that, of course I was little bit incredible. I was�I couldn�t believe that, but
you know what they say, nothing try, nothing lost. So, I went to this hotel. What I saw
over there was so unbelievable that again, I don�t believe what that I saw. I entered that
hotel and there was this beautiful�what do you call it? Not reception room, what is�the
lounge. And the first thing that caught my eye was this tremendous coffee table with
tropical fruit on it�bananas, oranges; there was some regular fruit, too. And I just
couldn�t believe it. First I thought it maybe it was artificial or something, but no, they
were real fruit.

Here I am, few weeks, maybe a couple of months away from the ghetto. I still see the
pictures of the ghetto, of the burning�I almost smell the burning, you know, of the
people and buildings. It was still in my nostrils. And here I see this thing, and I (laughs)
had to pinch myself. Of course I�m not really going to pinch myself, but I thought, �Is
this real, or is this something?� You mean, how lucky am I going to be, to go to South
America. And I was always�as a kid I loved geography. I always imagined myself going
high places, to the South Pole and all that. Wouldn�t it be nice to go to South America? I
heard about South America. I know there�s Andes over there, Aconcagua. I say, �Oh, my
God!�

And I see these people sitting over there luxuriating in this opulence of this lounge over
there, and I�m told that�go upstairs and talk, register for their thing. So I went upstairs,
and there is a�as a matter of fact there�s a�if you double this, it was just like here,
almost the same color of the table. And there were ten guys sitting like a board of
directors, and they asked me. �Well this is�of course I want to go.� So, they gave me
some money, gave some money. I said, �Well, I also have a sister, who�� I took money
for her.

As I was coming out, I saw two notorious�one German and one Jew collaborator come
into this hotel. When I saw it, my heart stopped almost. But right�I was little bit�I
wasn�t sure that I was going to go to South America, that I wanted to go via this
particular way. But when I saw these two my mind was made up, and I couldn�t wait to
go to the telephone and tell my sister, because she knew what I was doing. Just forget
about it, we�re not going anywhere. And when I was�as I left that hotel, I was always
aware of the fact that these blackmailers, you know�remember I told you


szcmalcowniki? These blackmailers, where would they congregate, where would they try
to find somebody to blackmail, if not a Jew coming out from the hotel? Because they
knew�everybody know.

CE: Right.

JR: And I was in such stress. I had money with me, and I thought there were two guys
over; they eyed me, you know. So I gave them a slip, and I left. I got on a train. I left
Warsaw. And I never told him [Janusz]. He might have waited for me that night.

I communicated with my [sister]�after that, I never came back to Warsaw. And when the
war was coming to an end, I found my way to a town that was already liberated by the
Russians, Lublin. It�s the place where that very notorious Majdanek concentration camp
was�death camp. Majdanek, on a scale of brutality and killing machine, was probably
just beyond Treblinka and Auschwitz. And I was�I found�as a matter, I got a job with a
security firm over there. It was sort of quasi-military thing. As a matter of fact, I think I
mentioned to you before one of the commander�the commandant of this detail was the
one who helped me to get to the sanitarium when I got sick.

And we were guarding four prisoners, German prisoners. They were just�looked like
normal human beings. We got friendly with them, they got friendly; they were very nice.
We were nice to them, they were nice to us. And they were working very hard. We felt
very sorry for them because they were dismantling industrial printing plant or something,
and they were loading and unloading this machinery, heavy machinery. And it was warm;
it was July or something like that. And we felt very sorry for them, because the Russians
were getting everything back to Russia.

One day we got four other people, and we ask our foreman, �What happened to the other
ones?� �Oh, they�re on trial.� �On trial for what?� They were guards from the Majdanek
concentration camp, they were�caught prisoners. And I went to this trial. It was the most
unbelievable experience. I went through four years of hell and I thought I knew it all, but
what I found from the witnesses that were brought on in stretchers�you know, half alive
�were testifying against them�

They were sentenced to death, of course, by hanging. The hanging was in public on the
ground of the Majdanek concentration camp, which I attended also. But what I remember
�and I will remember it for the rest of my life�that the judge who sentenced them to
die, in pronouncing the sentence, he said something to the effect that he knew that was
not done. Nothing like this has been done ever in a history of jurisprudence, but he�ll add
�he would like to add as his wish to the sentence, and he said, �I wish that when you


catch your last breath, when the noose is tightening around your necks and your sight is
affected, is become�against the opacity of your eyesight, you will see a picture of a
mother with a child in her arm being pushed in a gas chamber.�

And I think that if nothing else you can talk about the Holocaust, you can bemoan the
tragedy, the death of the death of the people. But what he said in one sentence was the
quintessence of this thing, because what greater sacrifice is there for a mother knowing
that she is going to witness execution of her child? And to me, this is something that�
there are certain pictures that I always remember, I always will remember, and there are
certain sounds that I always have in my mind. And this is one of those things that I
always remember.

CE: Is there a message that you would to put on the end of this to people?

JR: Well, what I�well, if I had my way, if I could, for example, pronounce something
that would carry weight�and I said that I wrote this once before long time ago. And I
think now that I think about it, I think that we should write a new chapter in the human
ecology, and I don�t mean a human ecology that deals with humans interacting with
nature. It�s the ecology of human spirit where humans will interact with other humans.

Because we have come to such tremendous achievements scientifically�I mean, we
don�t need any more discoveries that will tell us how subatomic particles travel with a
greater speed than light. We have enough of that. We should be able to have
understanding between one human and the other one, because if we don�t achieve that, no
physical spectaculars in science, in medicine, in biology will help us survive. I think if we
can possibly do it, that�s what we have to work: to eradicate the hatred, the
misunderstandings, the misconceptions. And if we have accomplished that, I think this
will be greatest achievement ever for humanity at this point.

CE: Do we have another couple minutes? Two minutes? Okay. Then I think we�ll�let�s
stop here for now.

JR: Okay.

Part 3 ends; part 4 begins

CE: This is July 1. This is tape four, interview with Jerry Rawicki. So, Jerry, let�s start,
then, with liberation.


JR: After I attended this trial of those four concentration camp guards, I was so happy. I
was so ready to leave Lublin. The Russian army was poised at the eastern side of the
Vistula River, and on the other side of the river, the Poles rebelled against the Germans.
There was that�I think it was�the rebellion was going on for many, many months now,
and the Germans�the Russians had the capability of crossing the river. There was a
whole Russian army [ready] to liberate Warsaw and could help the Polish underground
against the Germans. But the Polish underground in Warsaw at that time was affiliated
with the Polish government in exile in London. And they [the Russians] decided not to
intervene. So, there was political push and pull. And they were waiting to cross the river
to make a final assault to continue all the way to Berlin, until the Germans quelled the
uprising in Warsaw.

So, when they finally built the pontoon bridges and all that, I hitchhiked with the Russian
army, and I went to Warsaw. I looked up the place where my sister worked and where I
was rescued by my rescuer. The whole neighborhood was demolished, and I continued,
all the way to the Polish recovered territories, because in a deal between the Allies,
Russians and the Western powers, part of eastern Poland was ceded to the Russians, and
part of the western Germany was ceded to the Poles. One of the cities that was in that
recovered territories that Poland recovered, that historically were supposedly belonging
to Poland, was the city of Wroclaw�German Breslau.

I resumed my studies, and I was working and studying. We went there just a couple
weeks after the Russians liberated that particular part of Germany, now Poland. Germans
were so scared. Those who were Nazis, of course�and most of them were�they just
fled. They didn�t want to be caught by the Russians. And everything was left as they
avoided the Russians.

We had our choice of apartments. I and a friend of mine acquired an apartment with a
Bechstein piano, a very, very wonderful apartment. There were�everything was left just
as they lived, two or three days before. In that building, in that area, some of the Germans
were left, but they were so scared of us. I was eighteen years old, nineteen years old; my
friend was a little bit older. At night, they were so afraid that we would come to their
apartment and tell them to get out that they were banging on pots and pans. There was
such a din (laughs) that almost annoyed us, but this was their way of�I don�t know,
saving themselves from our intrusion.

And I was thinking about it, how ironic it was that we could have anything that we
wanted because they inflicted such pain on us�of course, they didn�t know that we were
Jews, because they thought Jews were already gone. But they thought of Poles, as Polish
people, and they knew what they did to the Polish population, too. So, as I think of it
now, it was eerie. You know, we could get everything we wanted. I remember there were


�this apartment that we took, this was the first one; then we took another one
somewhere else, because then I lived in one and my buddy lived in another one. And it
was a beautiful�one was�I know the names of the streets, and it was just unbelievable.

At one point, my friend knew how to ride a motorcycle. I didn�t even know that he did.
But I [remember] one day�he comes in and says, �Rawicki, let�s go for a ride.� I said,
�What do you mean?� We found a motorcycle, so we got a motorcycle. It was just
unbelievable. And this shows you that�what they say, what goes around, comes around,
or vice versa.

It was just unbelievable. And I said to myself, This is exactly what the Germans did. The
movie that I saw, the Polish movie Border Street [Ulica Graniczna, 1948], there was a
street�there was a scene where they just told the�they found out that the Jewish doctor
was�that the doctor was a Jew, and they told him, �Get out.� They appropriated the
apartment and everything else. We did the same thing to them, but of course on a smaller
scale. We didn�t hurt anybody.

So, then I worked and I attended school. We had an accelerated course that led to my
entry into university. I had one year of law school, and the Russians insisted that I either
give up my passport, because I was waiting [for a] visa from the United States, from my
family�from my aunt�or I just leave. Which I left, because I figured that I could
resume my studies in the United States, but it didn�t happen.

So, when I got to New York and I was hoping that I would prepare myself so that I can
enter university, I came across a professor who was a dyed-in-the-wool communist. And
he had a real vendetta against me. Why? Because I left that socialist paradise and came to
these bankrupt, terrible United States. So, I was heartbroken I couldn�t, you know, pursue
my studies, what I wanted. I always wanted to be�ever since I was a little kid, I thought
I would study law someday. And I decided to be�went to a trade school, became an
optician. One of my assignments took me to manage an optical department in Pittsburgh.
I met my wife. I got married. I had a wonderful two children, a daughter and a son, and
that�s how my odyssey ended.

CE: What are their names, your children?

JR: The daughter is Susan, and son is Andrew.

CE: And tell us about Susan, where she lives and what she does.



JR: Susan lives near us. She has a daughter, a twenty-one year old daughter. My daughter
Susan is an assistant principal in Osceola Middle School. I�m her father, so I�m a little bit
(laughs) prejudiced, maybe, but she�s a wonderful person. She just�she has more friends
than I know people. She is just very, very�she�s just a wonderful person.

My son�again, I�m prejudiced, too. He�s a very nice guy. He is in�he lives in southern
California. He�s a petroleum engineer. He started as a�he�s a graduate from Penn State
University. He started as a roustabout on an oil rig, and now he works in (inaudible),
where he has an upper management position with Chevron. And he has a wonderful
family. He has a wonderful family, which has�he has three sons, two daughters, and he
has one foster child�I�m sorry, one adopted child, and now he has one foster child.

CE: Wow.

JR: They are so loving, and they are such wonderful people, again. People, when they
talk about my children, they say, �They just don�t make them like this anymore.� And I
agree with them.

CE: Lovely, lovely. And let�s end by your just telling us about your sister, where she is
and how she�s doing.

JR: Oh, yes. My sister is a very integral part of my life. She�s [born in] 1920; she�s
eighty-nine years old. She lives in Israel. Two years ago she lost her husband, and they
were married for about fifty-five years. She�s the most wonderful person. Her mind is as
clear as a nineteen year old. I talk to her every week, and we start with politics, we end
with sports. (CE laughs) It�s just unbelievable. She�s so�and now she became�within
one year, she has become a great-grandmother. So this is�of course to her, it�s a joy to
see these great-grandchildren.

She is an English�she is a dual citizen, because when I came to the United States, she
went to England, where she married an Englishman. As I said, they were married for
fifty-five years. She has two children: a son, who is a lawyer in England, and a daughter,
who is in Israel working in public relations. It is so amazing, because her son and her
daughter are almost carbon copies of my children, as far as the personality, and it�s just
the most amazing thing. I can sometimes listen to her tell me about her daughter, and I
think she�s talking about my daughter.


So, I think this tells you what my sister is. She�s a joy. And every Sunday morning, nine
o�clock�it�s two o�clock at her place, and I say to her, �Good afternoon,� and she says to
me, �Good morning.� And we just�the only thing that we don�t talk too much about is
about the Holocaust.

CE: And I guess you don�t really need to talk about that.

JR: Oh, no. We used to, but now she�s getting older, and I think it�s painful. We did talk
about it�I don�t know how it happened, but just a few months ago she told me about this
incident that she had when she was working in that coffee shop. And I was listening to it,
and sometimes I wished that she didn�t tell me, because I knew the pain that she went
through. She�s just as emotional as I am; same DNA, I guess.

CE: This has been just wonderful. Thank you for sharing your life story with me and with
everyone who will see this in the future. It�s quite a gift.

JR: I�ll tell you�well, you know it is�I don�t want to use the word pleasure, but it was
so wonderful to be able to share with you my story. And I hope it falls on a fertile ground,
so that people will�some young people, older people, especially young people who
twenty, thirty years from now will say, You know what, this guy was right. And maybe
what I did, what I said, and what you do will contribute to a better world, because you
have a stake in it. You�re doing as much as I do by keeping the flame, you know, alive,
burning.

CE: Thank you. Thank you.

JR: Thank you very much.
