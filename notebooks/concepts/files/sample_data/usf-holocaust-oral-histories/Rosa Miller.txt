Carolyn Ellis: The date is February 22, 2011. I am interviewing Rosa Miller. My name is 
Carolyn Ellis. We�re in Tampa, Florida, and the videographers are Nafa Fa�alogo and
Richard Schmidt.

Today is February 22, and I�m here with Rosa Miller. And Rosa, I was wondering, could
you tell us your full name and then spell it for us?

Rosa Miller: My name today is Rosa, R-o-s-a, Miller, M-i-l-l-e-r. I was born Rosa
Modiano, M-o-d-i-a-n-o.

CE: Okay. And the date of your birth?

RM: I was born on the fourth of December, 1929.

CE: Okay. And where were you born?

RM: Salonika, Greece; nowadays the city is better known as Thessalonike.

CE: Okay. And your age at the moment?


RM: I am eighty-one.

CE: Eighty-one. Okay. I would like to start back during your childhood, and have you
just tell us what your childhood was like.

RM: Well, we belonged to the Jewish community of Salonika, which was an essentially
Jewish city even though it was in Greece. The Jews in Salonika had come to the Ottoman
Empire, actually, because Salonika belonged to the Ottoman Empire until 1912, and they
forged a large community. There were about 68,000 to 70,000 Jews in Salonika, out of a
population of 250,000, so it was a significant number. And it was a Jewish city, because
the port used to close on Saturday because of the Sabbath, and the longshoremen, who
were mostly Jewish, did not work on that day. So I was born�it was a very tightly knit
community, but it was large, so you had a big choice of friends, if you wanted them. You
had a large family, usually, so people remained within their families, but the families
were all interrelated anyway, because so many weddings had taken place within the
community.

CE: Were your friends Jewish?

RM: Yes. Actually, I also had some Italian friends, because, strange to say, I always lived
in Greece�Salonika being in Greece since 1912, and I was born in twenty-nine [1929].
My family had an Italian citizenship, which had been�which had come down through
the ages. They originally left Spain or Portugal, I believe, around 1492 when they were
expelled by Ferdinand and Isabella, and they went all over the Mediterranean, the
Ottoman Empire being one of the main destinations. The apocryphal story is that the
sultan said at that time, in welcoming the Jews who were fleeing Spain, that �The King of
Spain must be very dumb, because he�s denuding his kingdom to enrich mine.� Because
he knew, with the arrival of the Jews, he would get more commerce, more arts and crafts
and more business and travelers and all kinds of people, so he was happy to attract that
group that fled Spain.

CE: Okay. So, tell me about your parents.

RM: My father was an Italian citizen, because the citizenship was going from father to
son, father to son, all the way down; and even though they never lived in Italy, when
there was a birth in the family, the baby was registered both in the Salonika civil�what
do you call it? In Salonika mayor�s office, and in Italy in Livorno, in nowadays�in
English it�s Leghorn.


CE: Can you spell that?

RM: Livorno, L-i-v-o-r-n-o, which is a coastal city in Tuscany, in Italy, and supposedly
that�s where the family started. But there is also a village in Tuscany called Modigliana,
and a friend who has done a lot of research on the Modiano family maintains that the g-l
was dropped, like the painter Modigliani; it was dropped when the people went out of
Italy, because it was very difficult for others, foreigners, to pronounce it. So from
Modigliana, it became Modiano. And I visited that little town. We were welcomed by the
mayor during a family reunion.

CE: Wonderful. And what was your father�s name?

RM: My father�s name was Dario. Actually, his name was David, David, but he was
called Dario commonly. Dario Modiano.

CE: And that�s spelled?

RM: D-a-r-i-o.

CE: Okay. And your mother?

RM: My mother, she was a Spanish citizen. Now, that�s another little story, apocryphal
perhaps. A Spanish diplomat visited Greece at the beginning of the twentieth century,
very beginning, and he found a whole community there�65,000 people�still speaking
Spanish after an exile of 400-some years. So he was so impressed that they had kept the
language�even though the language had become a dialect by then, because it had
accretions from other languages�so he offered Spanish citizenship to whomever would
take it. So my grandfather did, and therefore, my mother when she was born was a
Spanish citizen. Oddities, both times, with Italian and Spanish citizenships because I
never lived in those other countries.

CE: It is interesting, yes. And you had a brother?

RM: I had a brother, who was a very adventurous fellow. Unfortunately, he died when he
was thirty-seven, of cancer. So I was mostly an only child.


CE: So who else lived in the house with you, just the four of you?

RM: Just my father, my mother, and my brother and I. We had two Greek maids. And
that�s why, when I was born, I started my language learning in Greek because one of the
maids had kind of adopted me; I was hers and nobody else�s. So I spoke Greek for the
first language, and then I went to an Italian school: it was a government school, an
excellent one incidentally. And eventually I went to a Greek school, but at the same time I
had a French education because the Alliance Isra�lite Universelle in Paris had founded
schools to teach French culture and French literature throughout the Near and Middle
East. They were very good schools, and many of my relatives went to those schools: my
mother did, and so did her two sisters. Some people went to the German school and spoke
excellent German, alongside with Ladino, which is the dialect that occurred after the
Jews had been out of Spain for a long time. So French was the language of literature, of
polite people�of wealthy people, actually, because not everybody could afford to send
their kids to French school.

CE: What language did you typically speak at home?

RM: French. My parents didn�t speak good Greek, because they had never been in�they
had never lived in Greece. They were adults when Greece became Greek�when
Salonika, I�m sorry, became Greek. So they spoke it with an accent. Not my case,
because I was like a native, obviously.

CE: What kind of work did your father do?

RM: My father worked for a German company. It was a company that received the
German ships that came to the Port of Salonika, which was a very large port anyway. And
the name of his employer I still remember, as I used to speak of Mr. Heitman. And Mr.
Heitman was a very nice fellow�a gentleman, really�and he trusted my father
completely and he left the whole business, the whole office, into his hands. But this came
to an end when Hitler came. He wouldn�t allow German citizens, God forbid, to have
Jewish employees, so my father was let go regretfully by Mr. Heitman, who gave him a
very good severance pay. And then after that, he associated himself with his two brothers,
and they sold very fine suiting material, English material, for men.

CE: How do you spell Heitman?

RM: H-e-i-t-m-a-n.


CE: Okay. And did your mother work outside the home?
RM: No.
CE: Okay.
RM: Women did not work outside the home at that time. It was a dishonor�
CE: Ah, yes.
RM: �if this happened. Women were ladies of leisure at that time.
CE: Yes. Sounds wonderful.
RM: Yeah.
CE: So, would you describe your family as being upper class at the time?
RM: I wouldn�t say upper, but upper middle class, yes.
CE: Upper middle class, okay.
RM: Yeah.
CE: And talk a little bit about school.
RM: Well, I went to an Italian school at first, which had a very different feature. Of


course, the teachers came from Italy, and they were very good teachers usually. And then


once a week a Catholic priest came to minister to the kids who were Catholic, and at the


same time they brought a Jewish woman who taught us our first prayer in Hebrew. I have


never heard this in any other school that they would bring somebody of a different


religion, but the Italians did. And it was a school where if you were Italian�I have said


that before�you became a little fascist, you know. You belonged to the children�s
organization, you saluted the Duce [Benito Mussolini], and you wished him all the best.
You believed in all the songs about Ethiopia because that was the time where Italy
wanted to create an empire and attacked Ethiopia, and they used a little ditty that said
where the Negus, who was Haile Selassie, the emperor of Ethiopia, the Lion of Judah,
�With his beard, we�re going to make brushes to shine the shoes of Mussolini.� So, I still
remember it.

CE: Oh, wow. And were you good in school?

RM: I was the first in everything I attempted. I was first, and I was dumb enough to
believe that the letter we wrote to Mussolini every year�they always told me that mine
was chosen to be read by Mussolini, and I was dumb enough to believe it. But mine was
the best one, and maybe that�s where I started writing well.

CE: Maybe. Yes, yes. So, you enjoyed school?

RM: Yes. And we had the adunata, which was the meeting of the little boys and girls in
the fascist organization, on Saturday afternoon. We were very happy to go; but our
cousins, who were Greek citizens, used to go to the movies on that day, so there was a
little bit of ambivalence in attending the organization. But then, of course, we were
expelled. When the racial laws started in Italy, we were expelled from the fascist
organization as well as from the school, and that�s when I went to a Greek school.

CE: Okay. What year was that?

RM: What year? I think it was 1939 or forty [1940], around that time.

CE: Now, up to that point, did you feel any prejudice because you were Jewish?

RM: No! Not in the Italian school. All those teachers were very nice to us, and we used to
invite them to our home and my mother became very friendly with them. No, there was
absolutely no inkling of prejudice, and it was only because of Italy�s alliance with
Mussolini�I mean, with Hitler. That�s when it happened, when the racial laws started
being applied in Italy.

CE: And what about your religious life at home?


RM: Well, my brother had a bar mitzvah. I received absolutely nothing as religious
instruction. My parents went to services at the synagogue across the street from our home
maybe twice a year, for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and that was the extent of our
religious life. We did celebrate Passover with a big Seder. First evening we went to my
paternal grandfather and grandmother, and the second evening we went to my maternal
grandparents.

CE: Did you have a strong Jewish identity at the time?

RM: Well, it was a very strong Jewish identity, but it was nationalistic. It had nothing to
do with religion. We felt very Jewish, and intermarriage was frowned upon a lot, you
know. You were not supposed to marry outside your religion. My mother�s�not sister,
cousin, but she considered herself her sister, eloped with a Greek Orthodox guy and they
got married, and my grandfather decreed that nobody should talk to her anymore. And my
mother, who was a very courageous woman, said, �Who says that? She�s my sister and
I�ll do as I please,� and she kept up the relationship. Eventually he was accepted in the
family as well, but then they were divorced and she married a Jewish fellow; but that�s
another story, nothing to do with me.

CE: Okay. And so, at what point did things change? With the racial laws?

RM: Yes. You see, we were expelled from the fascist organization. My father used to like
to go to the consulate in Salonika, where things took place. I neglected to mention there
were about 500 to 700 Italian Jews in Salonika. That was it. And they formed a tightly-
knit community, and one of the most aristocratic families in Salonika would belong to
that group, the Fernandez family. It�s a very Spanish name, so it shows that they came out
of Spain originally. And then there was the Morpurgo family. These were the cream of
Salonika society, and they lived a wonderful lifestyle. I used to go to the places for
birthday parties, because I was classmates with some of the Fernandez kids. The maids
there served tea to youngsters like us: we sat at the big table, and the maid had lace and
everything, very, very aristocratic. They had a bad fate. Well, eventually I will talk about
them later; it�s not the place for it now.

So it was a tightly-knit community, and there was an interchange between the younger
generation and the older one. It was a very different thing. The older generation only
spoke Ladino. My grandparents used to read a newspaper that was written�I mean,
spelled�in Hebrew characters, but when you read it, it was Ladino. So that�s the only
thing they could read, actually.


CE: Wow.

RM: But when my parents� generation came, by that time we had the French education,
we went to the lyc�e, the fran�ais and so on. Actually, I didn�t go to a French school, but I
had a teacher who came�both my brother and I had a teacher who came twice a week
and taught us French spelling and French grammar and vocabulary. That�s how we
managed to learn three languages at one time.

CE: Wow. So, do you remember the first time you felt any kind of prejudice or that you
were being treated different?

RM: Well, you know, it�s interesting. There was always some prejudice in the Greek
community. For example, I had�when I went to a Greek school, I had a very good
friend, and one time she said, �Oh, this is just as noisy as the chabra,� which is the
synagogue in not polite Greek. In polite Greek it�s synagoge, but in not polite Greek it�s
chabra. And she used the term, and she immediately caught herself and said, �Oh, I�m so
sorry. I�m so sorry.� But it shows you that there was ingrained some kind of feeling
against Jews.

CE: So, can you tell me any details about when these laws were passed and how it felt?

RM: The laws were in Italy. We only felt the remote effects of it. My father could not go
to the consulate anymore wearing his black shirt, because that�s the amount�his
activities were limited to attending meetings at the consulate, and it was more a thing to
do rather than an obligation, you see, and he couldn�t do that anymore. And he had been
in the Italian army: he had fought in the First World War. He had been a pilot, of all
things, those rickety little planes.

There is a picture somewhere; my father standing against one of those cardboard things,
and the story went that he crashed against a storefront in one of those. I don�t know if it�s
true or not, but that was his reputation. So he was very upset, of course, because he was a
fervent Italian, you know, having fought for the country. More than we ever did, my
brother and I, because we were subject to a lot of other influences; in my parents�
generation, it was a limited thing, you see. You didn�t have too many opportunities to
travel or to do something, and you were very little schooled in politics. They didn�t think
about politics the way we think now. It was a very clear-cut thing: my politics are I�m a
Fascist; I go to the consulate in a black shirt, period. Didn�t do anything else, you know.
They only spoke.


CE: And then, so, talk about how things started to change for you.

RM: Well, they started to change when I couldn�t go to the Italian school. I went to a
Greek school instead, and I wasn�t familiar with the system of education in Greek. There
was another little girl who was the best one in the class, Lilette Reva. She was a good
friend of mine. She was very good, and I decided that I would be just as good because I
couldn�t stand the fact that I wasn�t going to be the first one, (CE laughs) the best one in
the class. So I doubled my studying and managed to equal her.

CE: Oh, wow.

RM: She eventually went to Mexico with her family, and she recently died.

CE: Did you keep in touch with her?

RM: Well, we weren�t in touch for sixty years, and then through some kind of quirk, we
got in touch again, and I saw her when we took a trip to Mexico.

CE: Oh, wonderful. So, what happened next?

RM: What happened next is that Italy attacked Greece. You know, Italy wanted�well,
Italy wanted an empire; that�s why it had gone into Libya, into Ethiopia and North Africa.
But they didn�t quite succeed. The Italians were not good soldiers�I think they were
only good for playing music and singing. And Mussolini, he maintained that he had I
don�t know how many hundreds of thousands of people under arms.

And Greece was a small country, so Mussolini decided that he wanted Greece and he told
�he gave an ultimatum to the Prime Minister of Greece�the King, actually; it was a
kingdom at that time�and said, �Open your doors. We�re going to march into Greece.�
And the answer was a resounding �No!� which is ochi in Greek, so that day among
Americans is known as Ochi Day, which was the twenty-eighth of October [1940].

So Mussolini, having refused�I�m sorry. The Greek Prime Minister having refused,
Mussolini sent his armies against Greece, and he was stationed in Albania already, which
he had occupied years before. So the war started in Albania, not in Italy proper or Greece,
because the Greeks advanced into Albania, and strange to say, their forces were much


smaller and poorly equipped than the Italians, but they repulsed the Italians for quite a
while back into Albania. And that lasted for about a�less than a year, if I remember, and
then Mussolini, losing the war, asked for Germany to reinforce his army and the Germans
started the campaign against Greece. And their tanks, of course, overcame the Greeks
very easily: the war lasted maybe a few days, and that was it. The Germans came.

CE: Prior to the Germans coming in, was your life different other than going to the Greek
school?

RM: No, not in any way. We were more anxious, I guess. News from Europe used to
come and be read with a lot of interest because we thought�we did not think that it
would touch us, actually, in the beginning. But by the time things had taken place, we
kind of knew that Greece would be involved, and it was occupied by the Germans, who at
first didn�t do very much against the Jews. It was strange. I still remember the day they
entered Salonika. We were behind the shutters�nobody was out in the streets�and then
we saw the first motorcycle drive up; you know, the Germans would. And it was such a
feeling, you know. It was a bad feeling, because we knew that nothing good would come
out of it.

CE: So were you and your family together watching from the window?

RM: Yes. Yes.

CE: And you could�you saw?

RM: Nobody was out. Nobody was walking.

CE: You felt very anxious? Do you remember?

RM: Very much so, yes.

CE: And I guess your parents did as well.

RM: And then what happened is that the Germans didn�t have enough space to house
their officers. They had barracks for the soldiers, but not for the officers. So they went
from house to house, chose the best room in the house, and told the people that they


would house a German officer and that they should give him the liberty of the house. So
they did for us, too. They came, and we had a succession of sergeants who stayed in our
house. Actually, my mother always told them from the very beginning that we were
Jewish, in case they didn�t want to associate with us or they wanted to leave, maybe.
Nobody, no German, ever reacted to it. That was very strange. And then, we had a
Viennese air force officer, a captain, and he was a real gentleman. More about him later,
you see, because he is involved in the Holocaust story. But he was a very nice human
being, and had nothing against Jews.

CE: Did you have to feed these people?

RM: No. We just had to have bathroom facilities.

CE: Okay, so they went somewhere else to eat.

RM: They went to their mess or whatever, yes.

CE: Okay. Was your day-to-day living, then, interrupted very much?

RM: Not very much, because they were away during the day. They were very polite, you
know: it was a presence that you saw in the house, but you didn�t feel it was bad. They
didn�t make it known that they were anti-Semitic, even if they were. So, we did all right.

CE: So you were okay with it, as a child?

RM: Yes, that was fine. And eventually they told those officers they couldn�t stay in
Jewish residences, so he left; this particular gentleman left. But he had done something
unbelievable before he left. We�ll talk about that with the Holocaust.

CE: Okay. So you have these soldiers staying in your house, and then what happens?

RM: Well, in the beginning the Germans didn�t do very much. I guess maybe they didn�t
want to raise doubts about the fate of the people, or maybe rebellion. Who knows? They
decreed, for example, that people should give up their radios. Everybody had to do it,
Italian Jews or Greek Jews. They had to give up their bicycles.


CE: Just the Jews?

RM: Yes. No, the radio was a common thing for the whole population. Bicycles they took
from the Jews, you see; then they took over their business. They couldn�t go to work in
the morning, they had to stay home. That�s when they had moved the Jews into a ghetto.

CE: All right. So, let�s talk about the ghetto.

RM: Yeah. The ghetto was�they delineated a part of the city where everybody had to
move into. Now, it just so happened that the house where we lived was within the ghetto.
But we, as Italians, did not have to move; even if we had lived outside the ghetto, we
would have stayed. But my mother�s relatives�two sisters, their families�they all
moved in.

CE: Because they were married to Greek men right?

RM: Yeah. They had been Spanish before because of my grandfather. When they married
Greek citizens, they became Greek.

CE: Now, if they had been Spanish still, would they have been exempt?

RM: Yeah. It�s a whole other story, you know, about the Holocaust that�s not well known.
Anyway, so everybody moved into the ghetto and it was very crowded, you see, because
you were moving at least half of the Jewish population in a tiny enclave. So life became
very difficult in the ghetto. I could go back and forth out and in without any problem. I
had an Italian ID card. And you know, as a child, I guess I was ambivalent. I was so
happy that I could do that. Somehow, I was allowed to do that when my cousins could not
do it. At the same time, I was very upset about it, because why did they make an
exception for us? I couldn�t understand, you see, and I wanted to be like my cousins. I
didn�t wear a yellow star, never did. The consulate said the Germans could not impose
anything on us, even though they were allies, you see. But it�s very interesting, the way it
happened.

CE: It is yeah. Did people move into your house, other people?


RM: No, no. My mother�s sister moved into my grandparents� house; there was space.
No, nobody moved with us.

CE: Do you remember how you felt at that point about what was going on?

RM: Yeah, as I told you, I was ambivalent. On the one hand, I thought I was very
important because I didn�t have to abide by those measures; on the other hand, I was
questioning why they and not me.

CE: Okay. So now you�re in the ghetto, and you�re able to go in and out but other people
are not.

RM: Yes, that�s right. They�re not allowed.

CE: And talk a little bit more about the conditions.

RM: Conditions in the ghetto were pretty bad, you know, because people were living five
to a room or something, more than that. The medical facilities were not that good,
although there was a very large hospital�well, not very large by today�s standards; a
large hospital that had been founded by the Baron [Maurice de] Hirsch, and he was a very
fabled Jewish man who contributed a lot to communities, to Jewish communities. So the
hospital, he had financed it, and it bore his name. That was the only place they could go
for medical treatment, and it�s not easy to serve a large population from a rather small
hospital, so health conditions were pretty bad. And starving occurred, because you
couldn�t go out and buy anything. You had to live on the resources, and of course the
black market took off like anything. My parents used to pay the price, because we
ourselves were suffering, even the Italians, because conditions were the same for
everybody. So we tried to help them as much as we could by buying things outside. And,
I must say, the German officer who stayed with us used to go hunting and bring us back
what he killed, and we would have a festive meal after that.

CE: Which officer was this?

RM: The Austrian.

CE: The Austrian.


RM: I might as well tell you about him.

CE: Okay, go ahead.

RM: You see, his name was Otto Wengersky. I remember very clearly.

CE: Can you spell his last name?

RM: Yeah. W-e-n-g-e-r-s-k-y. Otto, O-t-t-o. He had become accustomed to our family,
and he loved to stay with us in the evening and talk. My father spoke excellent German,
because he was employed by a German company. My mother had a few words of
German, but she managed to learn quickly. And he befriended us. He would bring us
food: bread from his mess; sugar, which was�you couldn�t find it for love or money. He
was very helpful. But then he had to move, because no German should stay in Jewish
residences.

So he came back at night sometimes to find out how we were, what we were doing, and
then he came one night particularly. The Jews were already in the ghetto; there had been
measures against them and so on. And he said, �Tell your family to leave, to leave
Salonika.� Well, why should they leave Salonika? Because Athens, which was in the
southern part of Greece, was occupied by the Italians, so you could cross the line of
demarcation and be in Italian territory�not that it was easy, and it was fraught with
danger. You could get�you could be seen as a Jew, recognized as a Jews. So he told us,
�Tell your family to go to Athens. They will be safe there. I just overheard today some SS
officers who came to Salonika, and they were discussing the deportation of all of the
Jews, and one even asked how many horses can you put in a��what do you call it? A rail
car.

CE: Yeah.

RM: And they said, �Forty, so we�ll put fifty�we�ll put eighty,� he said. So he reported
all of this to my parents. He said, �You won�t have to worry, because you�ll be protected
by the Italians. But tell your family to leave.� They did not. Only two cousins did, and
they survived and everybody else died.

CE: And what reasons did they give for not leaving?


RM: You know, I didn�t take part in discussions�I was too young. But it seems to me
that one reason would be, suppose somebody comes in here and says, �Tomorrow
morning you�re leaving with just one bag in your hand.� It�s not easy to do that.

CE: No, it isn�t.

RM: And also, it was dangerous to cross the lines. Older people could not do it anyway,
you see, and there were a lot of older people in the family. Disbelief, like an uncle, a very
nice older man, said to my mother, �What are they going to do to us? They will deport us,
they will put us in a camp and we�ll sweep the streets, and we�ll survive and come back
after the war.� That was a very common belief. They never could have believed that they
would meet death just as they arrived.

CE: Now, is your father still working at this point?

RM: No.

CE: No, okay.

RM: By that time, nothing worked right anymore, you see. They could, if they wanted to,
but nobody was buying anything. I maintain that I have bad toes because I couldn�t buy
new shoes and my feet were growing.

CE: Yeah. So, a little bit more about the conditions in the ghetto at this point?

RM: It was crowded, that�s the main thing.

CE: And people were starving.

RM: But you know, at least they were all Jews. It�s a funny feeling. You didn�t have to
worry anymore about somebody rejecting you. All your neighbors, all your friends were
right there. But it was a small area, and it created a lot of difficulties. Of course, when
they moved they couldn�t bring all their furniture; it was abandoned in the homes, like
many other things.


CE: Were there people dying on the street?
RM: I saw some in Athens later on. I didn�t see anybody in Salonika, probably because I


was more sheltered in Salonika. When we got to Athens I was taking care of family
affairs and I was out.
CE: So in Salonika in the ghetto, people weren�t going in and out unless they were

Italian?
RM: Yes. If you wore a yellow star, you couldn�t go in and out. And remember, there


were also Greek police and Jewish policemen as well�traitors, you know, who
collaborated with the Germans.
CE: So they had to depend on somebody like you bringing food in?
RM: In Athens, yes.
CE: I�m thinking still in Salonika.
RM: No, no, no. My parents were at perfect liberty to do anything they wanted.
CE: Yes, but I mean other people in the ghetto.
RM: Oh. Yes, they couldn�t. They lacked everything.
CE: That�s really hard.
RM: You could only live on the resources that you had within the ghetto. Black market,


of course, took care of some of it, but sums were enormous for flour, and there were no


ovens in the homes; you had to send it to a communal oven. That had been the case


before the war during the occupation, and even after the war it continued in Greece.

CE: There were no ovens.


RM: No ovens, so you prepared the plate uncooked and you go to the local bakery and
you entrust it to the baker, who would bake it or roast it or whatever for you. You saw the
maids coming back home with their big burden, covered with paper. Usually it was a
lamb roast and potatoes.

CE: Oh, so for each meal you had to go to the oven.

RM: Yeah. Well, not everything was baked.

CE: Yes, okay.

RM: They had developed a lot of recipes that just needed boiling or whatever.

CE: That�s interesting.

RM: And remember that we cooked with charcoal when I was a child, I remember, until I
was twelve or�until we were in Salonika, before moving to Athens, we used charcoal for
fuel. There was a delivery of charcoal every month or so: it was put in a closet under the
counter and the whole kitchen was full of charcoal dust, but it was a ritual that everybody
did without protesting.

CE: That�s interesting. I don�t remember seeing anything about this in your other writing.

RM: No, no, no. And then in Athens, we still used charcoal in a small�like a little
contraption here, which we called foufou, because you had to blow on it. (demonstrates)
You know, for the charcoal to light up. So it was called the foufou, and that was the only
way we could cook.

CE: Do you remember any specific details about your family helping other people during
that time?

RM: There might have been. The main thing was what my mother did, that�s what I
remember very well. You see, the Germans had decreed that if you were caught crossing
the lines of demarcation between German occupation territory and the Italians in the


south, you were executed immediately. Of course, you had to pay a Greek guy, Greek
Orthodox guy, to take you through the lines, because it was very mountainous terrain and
people didn�t know the way, obviously. So you had to pay�I don�t remember how much.
But the Italian consulate had told Italian citizens not to take any money or jewelry from
other Jews for safekeeping, because it was punishable by imprisonment or death or
whatever.

So my father wouldn�t take anything from anybody, but my mother, who was more
tenderhearted, had the visit of a friend who said, �I have twenty English gold pounds, and
I have to give them to the man who will take me through the lines. But I can�t take the
money with me because I don�t know that I will get to Athens. When I call you from
Athens, you can give the money to him.� And my mother agreed, against reason and
against better judgment. She felt that she had to help a friend who wanted to escape. Well,
the guy was caught when he was crossing the line, and the Germans beat�I mean, not
the Germans; it was the Greek collaborators beat him to a pulp. And he said that he had
given twenty gold pounds to Dario Modiano. He didn�t say Lily, my mother�s name. So
my father eventually was arrested and so on. But that was something my mother did,
which didn�t turn out good for us. But people tried to help each other.

CE: Okay. So, what happens then? You�re living in the ghetto area.

RM: We�re living in the ghetto. Neighborhood by neighborhood, people are being
deported. And that was when I saw the French movie I told you about recently, La Rafle,
because it was exactly the same. I left the movie crying. I went through it. I saw it
happen. It was harrowing. They would start coming on motorcycles, the Germans, and
trucks, and they would empty out in each street and they would go throughout the houses
and [say] �Raus! Raus!� meaning �Out, out!� And they had dogs barking, and lights to
light, because it was dark; it was like two o�clock in the morning. And they rounded up
the people. They didn�t put them in trucks; they had them walk to the train station from
where they would be deported to Auschwitz, and other places, too. And neighborhood by
neighborhood, Salonika�s ghetto was being emptied, because they would block one part
of it and get everybody out and put them in the trains to send them away, and the next
day, after two or three days, it would be another neighborhood. And that was harrowing,
because you saw the thing happening right in front of you.

And then the turn of our neighborhood came. That was terrible. We couldn�t be open and
watching, you know, because we had to be protected from the Germans coming in. We
had a little piece of paper on the door from the Italian consulate, which said that we were
Italian citizens and not to touch us. But you know, any German could have taken it out
and walked in. They didn�t. They respected it. They didn�t come into our apartment. We
had three floors, three different families. They took the ones from above and below us
and left us alone.


CE: Wow.

RM: And then you had to contend with a neighborhood where there was no life. You
walked out in the streets: empty. Houses: empty. Everything, it didn�t exist anymore. It
had just, like, disappeared in an instant after the people left, because after they left the
Germans came and then the Greeks came and took everything that could be used from
those houses, which you had left open, like walking out this door, you know, and leaving
everything behind.

CE: Were there other families left at that point, besides your family?

RM: Yes, the Italians, the families that were Italians. And the other ones, some had
escaped into Athens and most of them had stayed. They were taken away. I remember in
our yard, there was a little old house that was built there for the owner�s nursemaid. Two
old people, an old couple, and they couldn�t walk, they couldn�t do anything. He was bent
over. And they were walking; they were leaving at the same time as the others, and they
couldn�t walk. I bet they died soon thereafter.

CE: That just sounds so horrible.

RM: Yeah. You know, it�s one thing to talk about it; it�s another thing to experience it in
the flesh. I mean, how could this thing happen? It�s like if this whole Harbour Island is
blocked by policemen and they order you to leave.

CE: Do you know what they were telling the people about where they were going?

RM: Well, Poland. You see, people thought they were going to Poland, which of course
was right: Auschwitz was in Poland. They didn�t know Auschwitz then; nobody knew the
word. But they knew they were going to Poland, and they wanted�actually, they had
taken a lot of heavy clothes with them, because they knew that it�s going to be cold where
they�re going. They didn�t know that they wouldn�t experience cold or hot, nothing.

CE: Did they take a lot of things with them? Were they able to?


RM: Yes, a bag, and they put [on] three sweaters, you know, so to carry more. Of course,
it didn�t help them at all, because those belongings were abandoned upon arrival.

CE: Yeah.

RM: You know, I�ll tell you something: My mother was helping her sisters, who were
subject to deportation, you see. She helped them put�in the buttons, put diamonds inside
the button. People used to go to the dentist, who would put gold under their teeth, you
see, because they thought that that way they�ll sell the jewels, they will sell the gold, and
survive. They went to the heap upon arrival, and they had a special commando that
searched the clothes for such items.

CE: And they pulled their teeth, too, right?

RM: Yeah. Right.

CE: So you�re left in Salonika?

RM: Yeah. Well, we�re alone, nobody from our family except my maternal grandparents.
Now, let me tell you the story of the Spanish Jews, some who had taken on the
citizenship. They stayed in Salonika even after we left as Italians. We had been given the
choice, go to Italy or go to Athens, so we chose Athens. So the Spanish Jews remained in
Salonika. It was my grandparents and my uncle, his wife, and two girls�and others in
the community, about 400 people. One day they received the order to gather in the
synagogue, which they did, and from there they were taken�oh, I�m sorry, I have to
mention that there was a Spanish consul in Salonika who tried to protect the Spanish
Jews. He wasn�t very successful, because they deported those Jews to Bergen-Belsen.
Now, Bergen-Belsen was not a death camp like Auschwitz; it was terrible, but they didn�t
kill people there, they didn�t gas them.

So they took the Spanish Jews to Bergen-Belsen, where they were imprisoned for six
months or a year, I don�t remember. And then the American Joint Distribution Committee
intervened, and they tried to persuade the Spanish government to ask that those Jews be
freed and bring them to Spain. Well, Franco did, at that time. He didn�t like the Jews
himself very much, you know�he was a rightist, as you remember�but he allowed
those Jews to come to Spain, to be taken by train through France and into Spain. But he
didn�t want them to stay there.


So the odyssey of these Jews was that they went from Salonika to Bergen-Belsen. After a
while they were taken out of Bergen-Belsen, traveled through France, which was
occupied, into Spain, where they stayed for a few weeks until they could recover, because
they had suffered a lot in the camps. And they took them to Casablanca; the British took
over the protection, so they put them in the displaced people�s camp in Casablanca, and
eventually they took them to Palestine. Not Israel; there was no Israel at that time. They
arrived in Palestine, so they had done a whole round trip, and after the war finished they
came back to Greece.

CE: They did?

RM: Yeah.

CE: Okay. So, now what happens to your family?

RM: Well, we went to Athens, because we had a choice. That Fernandez family came to
my parents and said, �Let�s all go to Italy. We will be safe there.� My parents decided no,
they wanted to be in Athens. So he and his family left, wife and three children, and they
went to a small resort area in the northern part of Italy near Lake Maggiore and they
thought they would be safe. But they were betrayed, and the Gestapo found them and
arrested them, shot them on the spot, and threw their bodies in the lake.

CE: Who betrayed them? Do you know? You don�t know?

RM: I don�t know.

CE: Okay. And your family went to Athens.

RM: We went to Athens, where�my father�s two brothers were already in Athens. So we
joined them there. But we had a whole odyssey for that, as well. You remember that my
mother had gotten the twenty pounds from the friend.

CE: Right, right.

RM: What happened is that the friend gave my father�s name. So the day that we were
leaving on an Italian military train for Athens from Salonika, the train would not leave.


We waited and waited. It was my grandfather�my grandmother was already in Athens�
my father, my mother, and the two children. And the train wasn�t leaving. Then they
decreed that all the men should get out from the train and line up on the quay.

CE: So you didn�t know what was going on?

RM: No. And then we saw Dr. [Max] Merten�he was the Nazi in charge of the slaughter
of the Jews in Salonika�accompanied by the very infamous Jewish traitor. So he started
going over, looking at every man in the line, and he got to my father and he said, �You.
Out.�

CE: He was the first one he had pulled out?

RM: Yeah. He didn�t pull out anybody else. He said, �Now the train can leave.� (CE
gasps) Well, my mother wanted to stay because she wanted to be with my father. So the
Germans said, �You�re doing it at your own risk and peril, if you want to stay. You�re free
to go, but if you want to stay, you have to know that it�s not��it�s fraught with danger, in
other words. But she decided to stay anyway.

So my father was put in a Gestapo jail. He was not tortured, he was not beaten, but he
was really terrorized. My mother used to take food to him every day, and it was a prison
that was high up in the city. She had to walk a lot; there were no taxis, no transportation.
But the Germans were very respectful of my mother. She was really surprised. They
would call her Abgeordnete Frau, meaning �honorable lady.� Anyway, it took a while,
but through the Italian consul, who was an excellent man�Pietro Zamboni was his name
�the Germans finally allowed my father to leave, because the Italians had argued there is
an Italian court in Athens. This is an Italian citizen. We should try him in an Italian court,
not a German court. So they put him on a train with my mother, with two carabinieri
with the big hats, and his hands in chains, and he was put in an Italian military prison in
Athens, from which he was released a couple of weeks later because an Italian judge
decreed it�s not a crime in Italy to keep money for friends.

CE: Oh, okay. Good, good.

RM: So they joined us in Athens, and that�s another kind of story.

CE: One more question, and then we�ll stop for now. I�m just amazed that your mother
stayed there.


RM: She was a very courageous woman.
CE: And how she was able to get food for him every day and get it to him.
RM: I know. She was always like this. My father was not a very strong guy, but my


mother had a very strong will.
CE: Okay. Well, I think we�ll stop, and then when we start next time�
RM: It�s in Athens.
CE: We�ll start in Athens.
RM: Salonika now is in the background.
CE: Okay, good.
RM: We left Salonika, and there were no Jews practically. Some Jews did hide in


Salonika, but it was very difficult because they could be recognized very easily. They
really would have been totally isolated if they had stayed, but some did, and succeeded in
hiding.

CE: Were the local people helpful?
RM: No. No, no. As a matter of fact, after the whole thing finished, my mother went back
to Salonika to sell the few things that she had left behind, and a Greek guy came and he


wanted to buy something. She said no, the price was too low, and he said, �Ah, they
should have made soap out of you like they did with your others.�
CE: Oh!



RM: Yeah. There was anti-Semitism in Salonika because there had been so many Jews,
you see. If there are some Jews, say a hundred, there�s no anti-Semitism; but when there
are thousands and thousands�

CE: Okay. Thank you.

RM: You�re welcome.

Part 1 ends; part 2 begins

CE: We�re with Rosa Miller, and this is tape two. When we ended the last tape, you had
just arrived in Athens. So, let�s start with your arrival in Athens. Your father and mother
are still back in Salonika. Tell me your experience.

RM: Well, we were traveling with my grandfather. He only spoke Ladino, but he was an
Italian citizen. But my brother and I had fun. Obviously, we were worried about my
father having stayed, but this was such a new experience for us: to be on a train, to be on
an Italian military train with a nice Italian soldier singing love songs, you know�
Firenze stanotte, sei bella in un manto di stelle.1 So it did something to us. We had been
oppressed, you know, for so long in Salonika. That was kind of a relief for us.

So we traveled day and night, and it was dangerous in those years because the partisans�
mostly communist partisans�had gone up to the very high mountains of Greece and
were fighting against the Germans�not real fight, it wasn�t a battle that they gave, but
they would launch something against them. I�m looking for the word. And they would�
well, anyway, they would try to prevent the movement of the German armies. So I was
looking at those mountains as we were traveling, and I had heard of the partisans there, so
I was worried that we might have a bomb on the train or whatever.

Anyway, we arrived, and we had our two uncles and my grandmother already in Athens
living in an apartment. We necessarily joined them in that apartment, so it was kind of
crowded for a while. But my uncle had a very nice Greek Orthodox girlfriend who came
from an excellent family, and she helped us a lot, you know, because my parents�my
mother wasn�t there, so she tried to substitute for her. We even found that the Greek they
spoke in Athens was a little bit different than the Greek we had spoken in Salonika. The
pronunciation was a little bit different. For example, instead of zesti, we said zesta, you
know, and so on. So we were new to Athens, but we loved it right away because it was so
different from Salonika. The city was wider, and with Italian administration you didn�t

1Rosa is singing the song Firenze Sogna.


suffer like you did in Salonika. So we liked it right away, and we were well taken care of,
and then eventually my parents arrived and my father was freed from the Italian military
jail.

We rented an apartment, a furnished apartment, from another Jewish guy. And we stayed
there three months, during which it was like old times�except that we didn�t have the
family, of course, but otherwise we went, we did, we went to the movies. You couldn�t
eat out�there were no restaurants�but at least you had some entertainment. You were
free. You didn�t have to give any account to anybody, and especially we, as Italians, were
privileged, you see. Anyway, we�

CE: Was this true for all the Jews there?

RM: Yes. Yes, pretty much so. The Italians never did anything against the Jews. They
didn�t adopt any racial laws, absolutely nothing. It was like you were in Greece, except
that it was an army of occupation, you see, the Italians. But compared to the Germans,
they were easy, really easy. So three months of that, and we enjoyed it fully, and then
Italy made a separate peace with the Allies. And that was determining for us, because
there was no more Italian consulate or Italian administrator who would do something for
us, who could help us, nothing. We had to count on ourselves. Thank goodness we had an
excellent Greek Orthodox friend. He had worked in Salonika; he was from the part of
Greece that reverted to Bulgaria for a while, and the name was Didymoteicho; it�s very
difficult name.

CE: Can you spell it for us?

RM: Yeah.

CE: Okay.

RM: Yeah. D-i-d-y-m-o-t-e-i-k-h-o.

CE: Okay. That�s a very difficult one.

RM: Didymote�no, t-e-i-c-h-o. Yeah.


CE: Okay.

RM: Yeah. That�s it. So anyway, they made fun of him because he came from kind of a
village in that, but he was a very sophisticated guy. And from him I learned two
principles of good dressing. He said that linen is never so elegant as when it�s creased,
and that Burberry is never so elegant as when it�s dirty. (both laugh) So he was that kind
of a guy, you know, and he was an excellent friend to us. So when the time came, we had
to find a hiding place. He was at first�I�ll tell you, at first we went�we had a Greek
maid, and she said, �Why don�t you come to my house? I�m there with my husband, and
it�s a very lonely location and nobody will see that you are there, so why don�t you
come?� We did, my mother and I, because in the meantime the partisans had taken the
men in the family and led them to a village very high in the mountains. Germans didn�t
hazard to go there because they were afraid to be ambushed. So they went on that.

You see, there was a good reason why we should separate. We couldn�t remain as a
family all together, and women staying at home, even if they are seen staying at home�
well, that was the fate of the women anyway, to cook and to clean and so on. But if
somebody happened to see grown men staying at home and not going anywhere and
never going out, you become suspicious. So, we separated, and he found�well, we went
into this maid�s home. Our only entertainment in a one-room house was to go to bed at
night and start discussing the bedbugs crawling down. (laughs)

CE: Oh, my!

RM: Yeah. That was�and there was no bathroom, you know. We used to use a chamber
pot, and the maid would go and throw it in the fields.

CE: Oh, my. You had separate bedrooms?

RM: It was a one-room house.

CE: Just one room total?

RM: The maid and her husband slept in the kitchen, and my mother and I occupied the
room with a double bed, and that�s where we lived. We didn�t go out. It was quite far
from the city, you see, from any inkling of civilization. And we had mice at night, of
course, besides the bedbugs. So we didn�t last more than two weeks, and we begged our
friend to find us another place, which he did. A very nice family: they were Greeks from


Istanbul. And the husband worked; the wife was some kind of a seamstress; and their
mother, Marika, lived with them. We found a very congenial place, because they were
very nice people.

It�s interesting. One of the children to whom I was speaking at the Holocaust Museum
said one day, �What did you do for entertainment?� (both laugh) Well, we weren�t really
entertained, but I could go out, you see, freely, because nobody would recognize me. I
spoke excellent Greek, you know. I was just like anybody else, and nobody could look at
me and say, �Oh, this is Rosa Modiano�; you see, I was too young.

So we gave Yorvus�that was the name of our savior�any money that we had. You see,
banks did not do very good business in Greece, because the moment people acquired
money they changed it into gold and put it away. So we could rely on some resources that
my parents had, gold that they had sold and gotten the money for it, and we entrusted it to
this friend. Every week I would go by his office, and he would take a piece of gold, send
one of his employees to the Wall Street of Athens, and cash the money and give it to us to
live for another week: to pay the rent and to live for another week. That�s how we spent
about one year, with these people.

CE: For a year.

RM: They were wonderful people. And he�the husband had been able to take the radio,
which had been branched only on Athens�it had been sealed at the police station by the
order of the Germans, so you couldn�t listen to any other broadcast from anyplace else. It
was just Radio Athens, which of course was controlled by the Germans. So I would go
and he would give me some of the drachmas that he got from the gold and we�d live for
another week and we�d live for another week, until we were liberated. But we had to
leave there.

They were very nice people. He had been able to fix the radio, so at night we closed all
the curtains very tightly, and all the windows, and we listened to the BBC, the news of
the war on the BBC. That was fantastic. But they used codes, and it was so mysterious.
�The moon jumps over; the weather is very good this week,� and we knew it was code
for something important, you see. It was just wonderful, just to hear this without knowing
what was going on. Another entertainment that we had was hearing the Flying Fortresses
�that was the plane in World War II�fly over Greece on a mission elsewhere, because
they didn�t bomb Greece. We knew they were going to be our liberators, you see,
eventually.


So we left there because one day, two young men, Greeks, came into the house. They
pushed past my mother, who had opened the door, and went into the room that we were
occupying. One took a gun and put it on the table. And for one hour, for the better part of
an hour, they were grilling us. My mother from the beginning, when they said, �You�re
Jewish?� She said, �Yes, we�re Jewish.� �You want to go to the Germans?� [RM�s mother
said] �No. Okay, I have a little bit of money; would you like this money not to give us
away?� No. �I have a watch that�s worth something; do you want?� No. �What do you
need, what do you want?� They never really said anything. And they left after an hour,
leaving us there, obviously, in bad shape. The women in the family had not heard
anything that was happening. They were in the kitchen in the back and we were in the
front of the house. They left by saying, �Don�t leave here, because we�ll come back for
you tomorrow,� which is a strange thing to do, you know.

To this day, we have no idea what happened and how we were let go by these two young
men. The only thing that we could surmise is that another couple used to come to play
cards with them, and they saw that they were affording a little bit more food because we
were paying them rent, and they became jealous and they tried to frighten us so that we
could leave.�

CE: Oh, maybe.

RM: Maybe. I have no idea; it was not something that was ever explainable to me.
Whatever. But of course, we had to leave.

CE: Before you leave, tell me what was a day like?

RM: A day? I would go out in the morning, for example, and come back. There wasn�t
very much that I could buy. We used beet tops for spinach; beets were abundant. You
know, they�re so expensive in this country; they�re the cheapest vegetable in Greece,
practically. And we would cook, and it wasn�t easy to cook, you see, because it was only
that little contraption with charcoal, and we had to cook our food and they had to cook
their food. Sometimes we used to eat the same thing, but normally my mother would
cook for her and me what I would manage to buy when I went out.

Now, my mother went to a movie a couple of times�with trepidation, I should say,
because she was so afraid of being recognized. And we usually saw German movies,
obviously; that�s the only thing they brought to Greece. I had liked one song so much that
I learned how to pronounce it and sing it without knowing what it meant. �Ich brauche
keine Millionen, I don�t need any millions,� and so on and so forth. My grandparents


were also in Athens, hiding in a section of the city that was kind of far from where we
were.

Now, there�s something very funny that I�m going to tell you, not to take away any of the
gravity of the situation, but it was funny when it happened. They were hiding on the first
floor of a house with two floors. A Russian�a White Russian woman lived on the second
floor. It was in a suburb kind of far away from Athens, from main Athens, and we had to
take buses to get there to them. We did it once in a while, and my mother affected what
some of the Greek women did at the time: in order not to get the sun on their face, they
would take a gauze scarf and put it on their face like this. Nobody could see who it was
behind that, so my mother used the stratagem. We visited our grandparents�her in-laws
�that way.

There was an older lady who was sister to my grandfather�a very stolid lady, I
remember�and her name was Tia, which is aunt, Gracia, G-r-a-c-i-a. And Tia Gracia was
very deaf. So when she said something, it was heard, really, and the place was right on
the street, so anybody who would go by, if they heard that kind of an accent, that kind of
word, they knew it was Jewish and they could very well go and betray them. So every
time she would say something, my grandparents would jump on her. �Shh! Shh! Don�t
talk, don�t talk! They will be hearing us.� Okay, so she sighed, (sighs) and there�s �Shh!
Don�t talk, don�t talk!� So one day, finally she said to them, �Do you mean to say the
Germans will find out we�re Jews on farts and sighs?� (CE laughs) Because that�s what
she used to do, you know, pass gas.

CE: Yes, yes.

RM: �Is it any different for Jews than it is for Greeks?�

Anyway, so when we had to leave, that was the only refuge we could find, because you
couldn�t go to a hotel, obviously; you were in hiding. You couldn�t go anywhere, because
there was a curfew, so it was very dangerous. So we decided to go to them, even though it
was far away. We traversed Athens�thank goodness nothing happened�and we got to
the house. The Russian woman from upstairs was very kind. She gave us a mattress to put
down on the floor to sleep at night. We stayed two or three days. There was a German
barracks on the other side of the street, and you know how we were afraid of being found
out. But nothing happened, and our friend found us another place, a young woman who
needed the money, and she had a much better house than my grandparents were staying
in. She was very nice, educated young lady. So we stayed there for a few months, and
then finally the Brits came, finally.


CE: Now, did you continue your education?

RM: Well, it was interrupted, obviously. So when I went back to Greek school, I was two
years older than my classmates. That was not good, because again I was the best one in
the class, you know, and the other ones would contend I was because I was older by two
years.

CE: Right, right, right. Did you read books while you were in hiding?

RM: Yes. As a matter of fact, that was a main feature. There was a lending library in
downtown Athens, and the guy who owned it was an intellectual with a beard and long
hair, which was not common in Greece at the time. Soukalas was the name, and he had
the lending library. I would go by there and borrow books and take them back and take
the other ones. He never said anything to me. I mean, we talked; he recognized me, we
talked. Only after the war, he said, �You know, we knew you were Jewish, but we didn�t
say anything.�

CE: Did he know your name at that point�or you used another name then.

RM: Of course. Yeah. The name I used�we had false ID papers, you know, that you had
paid a police administrator to get. My name was Marianthi Ni Kolaidhou, which sounds
very Greek, of course, and I had to get accustomed to the fact that if they said Marianthi,
I should answer, you know. But thank goodness, we didn�t have too many people with
whom to do it, so it didn�t make any difference.

CE: How did you and your mother do, being together all this time?

RM: We became very close.

CE: You did?

RM: Very, very close. And later on, when I fell in love with a Greek Orthodox guy, she
didn�t understand the idea of my marrying him, not in the least. I�m just as happy that she
did, because that way I met my husband. Going back to a normal existence was kind of
difficult, you see. We had lived in that threatened state for so long that�well, first of all,
it was like a new world, that you could go out and not worry about being recognized, that
you could go out and go to a restaurant if you liked. We had not become accustomed to


those things; actually, we had lost the habit by being in a place, hiding in a place,
although the hiding was not like Anne Frank�s, for example, where they never went out,
they were in a secret part. We were like guests in a house where we paid rent.

CE: But your mother never went, or rarely went out.

RM: Rarely, rarely. I did at will, you know, because I was okay. The two young men
never came back. I don�t know why. It�s very difficult to explain why.

CE: So any other close calls?

RM: No, that was the only one. Of course, they had a difficult time up in the village, the
men in the family. There was no food�it was a very poor village�and people used to
farm. What did my parents know about farming or anything? They just lived there. There
was no newspaper, no books, no nothing. Eventually my uncle�s girlfriend went to take
care of them; that was heroic on her part, because here you had four men to take care of
and wash and cook and do things for them. But she was very nice.

CE: Do you remember the day of liberation?

RM: The date I don�t remember, but I remember the�

CE: Would you remember that day?

RM: Yes. We all went downtown; we went out, you see, to see the Brits come in. And it
was like �Is this finished? Is this nightmare gone by now?� And of course, pretty soon
after that, we had the communist revolution in Greece. They became�they were
communists, and they took over, and of course they had all those partisans with weapons
that had been provided to them by the Brits and the Americans; they were very well
armed. So Athens was�well, part of Athens was in the hands of the partisans, and part of
Athens under the Brits.

CE: And what impact did that have on you?

RM: Well, you know, it was a civil war that was happening, and it was happening right in
Athens. There was no food, nothing. You couldn�t buy anything. Everything was closed.


It�s like it�s happening today, I guess, in Libya or whatever, only people were not
protesting at that time.

Then there was the news one day that the synagogue was distributing some food, some
flour. So we decided to go: my mother stayed home, my brother, myself, and my father
went. And you know, we had to cross streets where they were shooting from both sides,
so we had to take protection behind the wall and wait until the shooting was over and
continue. It was a long way to the synagogue; it wasn�t next door. So we managed to get
something, because they would distribute some flour and some sugar, so we managed to
bring it back home. And when you baked bread, you didn�t bake it, you prepared it and it
went to the bakery, if you remember. There was a partisan, a communist guy, right there
at the counter, so when you would pay for the baking of the bread he would cut a big
piece of your bread and say, �That�s for the heroic ELAS.� ELAS [Greek People�s
Liberation Army] was the organization, the communist organization.

CE: Wow.

RM: So you had to say yes, because they were in power.

CE: So liberation, then your father and brother came back?

RM: They returned. They returned.

CE: And you hadn�t seen them for quite a while.

RM: A year and a half.

CE: A year and a half, okay.

RM: They were returning back to nothing. We had no possessions anymore.

CE: Did you still have some money?

RM: A little bit.


CE: A little bit.

RM: A little bit to start, but it wasn�t much, you see. And we remained at that young
lady�s house quite a while, where we had just one room because we couldn�t afford
anything else. Eventually we got�I don�t know where they got the money. I really didn�t
care much at that point. I don�t know, maybe they had some reserves that they had given
to a friend, I�m not quite sure. But it was a while before my father started working again.
And interestingly enough, they received letters from the German company who would
like for them to resume their post.

CE: Wow.

RM: Yeah. They wanted to show that they were not the bad Germans.

CE: Uh-huh. And so you continued living in Athens.

RM: Yes, we never went back. There was no reason for us to go back. Other people had a
lot of real estate property; we never did.

CE: You didn�t own your house?

RM: No.

CE: You didn�t.

RM: No, we rented. My parents always rented. Many people did that, you know; it was
the thing to do, rather than live in your own place. You rented the property and you paid
for your own rent.

CE: But you lost all your possessions.

RM: Absolutely. My mother went back and gathered whatever she could. A maid that had
worked for us in Salonika had kept some things together, but that was it. It was a new
beginning in a new city in a new school.


CE: Yes. But not long after liberation, you had the problems with the civil war.

RM: Oh, just six to seven weeks.

CE: Wow!

RM: A couple of months we had the problems of the uprising, and it was fighting, real
fighting, you know. We used to hear about it. And they damaged the Acropolis.

CE: Did you fear at that point that this is going to be just as bad?

RM: Yes, yes, that the communists would prevail. Sure. And it was only through the
massive aid that the U.S. started pouring into Greece that we could be saved. It was
through a program called Point Four, because it was the fourth point in a speech by
President Truman, to help Greece and Turkey to recover their previous status.

CE: So you started going back to school in Greece?

RM: I went back to school, where, as I said, I made the best grades. I was the one who
wrote the best things. And I�ll tell you, the funny thing was the school was owned by an
old maid, a very typically aristocratic Greek lady who was swathed in black all the time,
you see. They never called you in school by your first name; it was always Modiano. So I
became the best writer in my class and in the school, and the Minister of Education
decreed a competition one time, �Greece enlightens the rest of the world.� I wrote the
paper, and I was the one who won the competition in all of Athens. That Greek old maid,
the director of the school, was so upset that her good Greek Orthodox girls couldn�t write
something, the Jewish girl did! (both laugh)

CE: Good, good. So did you�I�m wondering about, like, having boyfriends and not
having boyfriends.

RM: Oh, that was totally out.

CE: And how old were you at this point?


RM: Well, about fifteen or sixteen.
CE: Fifteen, so ordinarily�
RM: Dates? My goodness. You got punished if you did. And if you did, you had to do it


secretly. So it was not something that was done. Girls did not date.
CE: So it wasn�t like the Holocaust got in the way, it just wasn�t done.
RM: No, not at all. It was, as the Germans say, verboten. That was it. You couldn�t have a


boyfriend and talk to him, talk to your parents about him. You could have one in secret
and meet him in the afternoon somewhere, but that was it.
CE: (laughs) Did you have one?
RM: In a garden. Yeah, I did have one, and my parents were very much against it.
CE: Is he the Greek Orthodox person?
RM: Yeah. Thank goodness I met my husband after that.


CE: So you graduated high school then?
RM: Yes. I was taking at the same time private French lessons to get my what they call
the baccalaur�at in French. It�s a diploma that is equal to a two-year college education in
this country. So after we traveled, my husband and I after I had my children, I decided
when I was forty years old to go back to school, and I finished the two years that were
left in three years and I graduated magna cum laude from Trinity College in Washington.

CE: Okay. Great.


RM: And that allowed me to get a job later on�not that I needed the diploma, because it
was a language job, and my degree was in history. But I loved taking the courses, and I
did very well.

CE: So, go back to Athens. You finish, you go to school. What happens in your life next?

RM: Well, I was one of the first young ladies in the nice society where we moved to get a
job. Actually, it was because the company, the owner of the company that imported
textiles, was a friend of my father�s. I knew some English at that time; I was taking
private lessons in English with an American. Incidentally, I thought he was the mafia and
he had left the U.S. because he was in danger of being arrested. He went to Greece and
just stayed in Greece and survived by giving English lessons. So I learned English from
him, and he was a very good teacher. So I got this job, and I was making some money�
my goodness, it�s amazing!�which I used for clothes, for this and that, never contributed
to the family budget; it was just for me. And then when I met my husband, obviously I
stopped working because I knew him for about six months, and he said, �When are we
going to announce our engagement?�

CE: (laughs) That�s how he proposed?

RM: That�s how he proposed.

CE: How did you meet him?

RM: He was a friend of my brother�s, and my brother had gone with him on a trip around
the Peloponnese, where he had had projects built�hospitals, health centers�and he
wanted to survey the progress. He hated to drive, so my brother was on vacation in
Greece that summer and he drove for him. And then he came home one day and said,
�My American friend has jaundice and he�s very bad in the hospital; you want to visit
him?� I was looking to improve my English anyway, and I thought I�ll practice, so I went
with him. And that was it. I went back and back and back, and then we were married. We
were married in Germany. And somehow I think I resented�I resented my husband
today�I didn�t at the time�for taking me to Germany to get married: the place where
we had lost so many people. When I finally thought seriously about it, I didn�t like the
idea, but it was done. We were in Heidelberg.

CE: Why did he take you to Germany?


RM: Well, he had a very good reason. The jaundice had left him in bad shape, and
Frankfurt in Germany had a very good hospital. So his superiors wanted him to go to
Frankfurt to get evaluated. So he decided this would be a good opportunity to get married
as well, and he had a friend in Heidelberg who was a chaplain in the army. A Greek rabbi
would not do for him; he had to have his American rabbi. So that�s why we went to
Heidelberg. My father came with me; my mother did not. It was very expensive in those
years to travel by plane, and that was my first plane ride ever.

CE: Wow. So where did you settle after you were married?

RM: Well, we came back to Athens, because he was settled in Athens, and three months
later we had to leave. I was already expecting my first child. We came to the U.S., where
I was naturalized in five days because there�s a government regulation that says that if the
government sends you on missions abroad, I have to follow as his wife, obviously. So it
may be ten years if they keep sending him abroad before I can become a citizen. So the
law said that they allowed the people who were sent on government business to become
naturalized much faster.

CE: And tell me again what your husband did?

RM: He was in the Public Health Service. He wore a uniform. I guess that�s what
impressed me at the time, the whites. The navies are okay, but the whites with the high
collar, you know�very elegant. So he contended that�no, I contended that I married
him because of his uniform. (CE laughs) That lasted until I had to starch it and iron it.

CE: That was enough.

RM: It had to stand up like this with the starch. You see, the Public Health Service is one
of the uniformed services of the U.S. There are five: the Army, Navy, Marines, Public
Health. They have Navy ranks and Navy pay, but they belong to a very special group that
deals with health matters: hospitals, medicine, clinics, whatever, and engineers, sanitary
engineers, water supplies, and so on. So he was a member of the PHS, and�well, he was
an administrator, and then a consultant as well. He retired after thirty years of service as a
full captain, which is the equivalent of a full colonel in the Army. That�s how we traveled,
because he was lent from the Point Four programs to the embassy, and he went to
countries and he dealt with the health situation in that country.

CE: So tell me the different places you�ve lived.


RM: Well, right after we were married, we were in the States for three months, and then
we went to Brazil. We were sent to Rio de Janeiro. To me, you know, for a little girl who
had only known hardship until then, with the Holocaust and surviving, it was like
something out of a miracle to go to Rio de Janeiro, that exotic place. We liked it very
much, and we had our first child there. We were thinking of going for a second term, and
then he was offered a position in Iran. All we could think of is we could stop in Athens on
the way and see the family, so we accepted to go to Iran, where we lived for four years.
On the way back we exchanged a first class ticket, which the government was generous
enough to let us have at that time�that�s changed now, of course�for tourist class. We
exchanged it for a tourist class ticket and took the longer way home, so we visited
Pakistan and India and Vietnam and Cambodia and so on and so forth. So that was a very
interesting trip.

And then when we left Iran after four years, we were sent to Ecuador. My husband got
very sick in Ecuador, again, and the altitude affected his chest and his lungs. So after a
while we had to go back to the United States�we didn�t stay a full stay there. And we
lived in Fort Worth, and I learned how to say Mrs. Baird�s Breads in Texan. (CE laughs)
After eight months�we had acquired a Great Dane, incidentally, and we were sent back
to Iran for two more years. The girls said that they wouldn�t leave without the dog. But
we had to find a way to transport him to Iran, so we found a ship that went around
through the Suez Canal and got to the Persian Gulf.

We were in Shiraz already. So we flew down to Abadan, where the ship was in port, and
the Italian�the American consul had kept the dog for a couple of days until we came. Of
course, the dog was as big as that, like a little horse. So we got the dog. The Persian
driver who came with me talked Iran Air to take the dog in one of the planes.

CE: Wow.

RM: And something unbelievable happened. The dog was poisoned after a year, but that�s
beside the point. Fast forward thirty-some years later: we�re in Baltimore attending a
wedding, and we sat next to a gentleman very nicely dressed. And at a certain point I said
something in Persian to my husband so that people would not understand. He looked at us
and said, �Oh, you speak Persian!� Yes, we speak Persian. Why? Well, we were in Iran
for six years. �Oh, I was in Iran, too.� I forgot to tell you that the dog�s name was Puppy.
Nobody had bothered to give him another name. So he said, �I was the consul in
Abadan.� �Well,� I said, �isn�t that a coincidence? We sent the dog to a consul in Abadan,
and we picked him up.� �Are you Puppy�s owners?� he said.

CE: Oh!


RM: That was thirty-five years afterwards.
CE: Wow!
RM: It was really something. Yeah. What a coincidence. We couldn�t believe our ears.
CE: That�s great. (laughs) That�s wonderful. So then after Iran the second time?
RM: We went to Ecuador. No, no, after Iran we went back to Washington.
CE: To Washington.
RM: No, actually no. Sheldon retired from the Public Health Service after thirty years of


duty, and he accepted a contract with Tulane University to go to Brazil, where Tulane had
a joint program with the Brazilian government and the USAID organization. It didn�t
succeed, so we came back to the States after living in Brazil for ten months. Came back,
and Sheldon started applying for positions. He did not actually make that, but he got a lot
of consultant jobs. And I decided to go back to school, get my degree, and get a job. I
finished three years in two years that I had left, and I applied to the CIA. It was a whole
year before my clearance came through, because we had lived in so many countries, but it
finally did. I started as a [GS] 7, the grade of a secretary, even though I was a linguist,
and I think I doubled that in no time at all. I retired as a 14, which is pretty high in
government. I worked seventeen years for the CIA.

CE: Seventeen years.
RM: Eighteen, actually, and five years for the NSA.
CE: Wow. And what was your husband doing all that time?
RM: Consulting.
CE: He was doing consulting.



RM: Yeah.
CE: And then when did you come to Tampa?
RM: Well, I had finished the twenty-three years; he had retired long before I did, because


he was eleven years older than I was. So we decided to come. I wanted to continue
working�I could have worked until I was eighty-five or whatever�but he needed me at
home. His vision was very poor by then; he was legally blind. So I decided I have to
retire, unfortunately, because I loved the job and they loved me. And we came to Tampa
because we have the two girls in Orlando and Lakeland.

CE: So it�s kind of in between�well, not in between, but close by to both places.
RM: Yes.
CE: What year was that?
RM: I always forget. Two thousand? It�s eleven years. Two thousand one, I guess.
CE: Eleven years, so 2000.
RM: Yeah, 2001 we came. Dates I don�t remember too well.
CE: Yeah, I don�t either anymore.
RM: I don�t pay much attention. I know in general.
CE: But the older dates you seem to know.
RM: Oh, yes. Well, they were the most important ones.



CE: Yeah.

RM: That was like the date we were leaving Salonika: it was June, a very hot day, and I
remember the lineup of the men and how amazed and terrorized we were when the
German motioned to my father to step out.

CE: So you have two daughters?

RM: Two daughters, yes.

CE: And what are their names?

RM: Ann and Joan. I would have liked more fancy names, but my husband had had
parents who liked fancy names. His name was Sheldon. His older brother was Chester.
His younger brother was Carson. So when the time came, he says, �I want plain names.� I
would have liked something better than Ann and Joan, because in every other language
they sound the same: in Greek it�s Anna, Yoanna; in French it�s Anne, Jeanne. It�s only in
English that you say Ann and Joan. And my mother never learned how to say Joan. She
married John, so it was �Jon� for both of them.

CE: Oh, okay.

RM: You know, she never could say �paper� and �pepper.� It�s very difficult to
distinguish between the two sounds for a foreigner.

CE: Yeah. Let�s talk about your parents. What happened to them?

RM: Well, they stayed in Athens, obviously. They were really�they were longing for
me, because my brother had gone to the Congo, the Belgian Congo, to work, where he
got�well, I don�t know that he got it there, but the sun was very bad for him. He had
melanoma, and he died at thirty-seven. He had married before that and they had a little
girl, named Lily after my mother�s name. And they had moved to Belgium, because he
had a lot of people whom he knew in Belgium from the Belgian Congo, and he was the
representative of the big machines, the coffee�the espresso machines, you know, the big
ones that they had. But he died very early. His widow and the little girl lived in Milan,
and she married a cousin so she didn�t even change her name. She was a Modiano; she
remained a Modiano. My parents�my mother looked after my father for twelve years.


He had a stroke and he walked with her arm, and my husband decided�that was really
generous of him�that they would do better in this country, where we could take care of
them, and if they became his dependents they could get medical care free. So we brought
them to the States, and they lived with us. My father lived only three years; my mother
lived with us for thirty years.

CE: Wow! So you really did have a close relationship with her.

RM: Yes. But it was kind of difficult at times. You know, I was in between my husband
and my mother, and it�s not a good position in which to be.

CE: No. No, it�s not.

RM: But we managed, and my mother died just a year before we decided to move. She
would never have been able to move to Florida. But he was a very generous guy,
Sheldon.

CE: Very, very. And when did he die?

RM: He took care of them. Four years ago, in May.

CE: Four years ago, uh-huh.

RM: But I stayed here because I�m comfortable here. I have friends in the building. I
have friends from the synagogue. And I continue�I have a pretty active life. I volunteer
at the Tampa General Hospital, and I try to stay�what should I say?�informed of
what�s going on. I like it in Tampa. Tampa is a lovely city.

CE: Good, good. I do, too. And you volunteer at the Holocaust Museum, too.

RM: Well, it�s not on a regular basis. They have asked me to stay to, actually, give
speeches to the people�the students from schools. I want to show you the invitation that
the Holocaust sent out�the Museum�because it�s very interesting.

CE: Don�t get up with this [the microphone] on.


RM: Oh, that�s right. Yes, I forgot. I�ll show you afterwards.
CE: But what we�ll do, we will take a photo of it at the end of the�
RM: Oh, you can actually�if anybody wants to walk to the office, I have some yellow


envelopes on the side, if you can bring one of those. I have the pictures in there.
CE: We can�when we�re done here, we�ll turn the tape off and then we�ll get it.
RM: Oh, I see.
CE: And take a photo of it.
RM: Yeah.
CE: And let you talk about it.
RM: It�s a very interesting photo of my grandfather with all his grandchildren.
CE: Okay, good. Good. That will be wonderful.
RM: And I�ll also show you�talking about Sephardis, you know, there are many things


that are different in cooking between the Sephardis and the Ashkenazis. I mean, some


things are totally different and some are cooked a different way. I don�t think Greeks�


Greek Jews�ever cooked brisket the way you do here. As a matter of fact, are you


familiar with the Brisket Brigade?

CE: No. No.

RM: Well, when a wife dies, the other widows ply the widower with brisket.


CE: Oh, okay.

RM: They call it a Brisket Brigade. (laughs)

CE: Oh, that�s wonderful. Yeah. So, talk a little bit��cause you mentioned it when we
were having lunch�about the way the different Jews feel about each other, the Sephardi
and the Ashkenazi.

RM: Yeah. You see, as I said, Sephardis thought of themselves as the aristocrats. They
were, once upon a time, during the golden age, like Maimonides and Rashid [al-Din
Tabib] and so on. But they claimed that they were the only ones who maintained the
culture and civilization, which is wrong, because the Ashkenazis did just as much for
culture. But Sephardis eventually turned into just merchants, you know. There was no
more of that air of aristocracy about the Sephardi. Actually, it passed into the hands of the
Ashkenazi, because they produced people like Einstein, you know, and all the scientists.
But nevertheless, it did not prevent the Sephardi Jews to despise�to this day despise�
the Ashkenazi Jews. We were better than they were.

CE: Okay. And then I wanted to ask you about telling your story and what impact that has
on you.

RM: Well, you know, I was nearly in tears when I spoke about when they were rounding
them up, because this was the worst thing I could have seen. The way they came, like a
horde of savages calling for the people to get out, putting the dogs on them, you know.
And these were old people; they could hardly walk, you know, and they were burdened
by the stuff that they thought they could use. It was heart-rending. And our relatives were
among them. And then there was�well, I better not talk about it, I shouldn�t�about an
incident with one of my cousins. But it�s too bad; I don�t want to talk about it. So every
time I think of that, and especially when I went to the movie and it was depicted in vivid
color in front of me�how could it be possible? I don�t understand. What did these people
do that they had to go, to leave everything they had for a lifetime? That�s very bad for
me. But on the other hand, I want the story to be known, to be told, because there are so
many doubts already. Eh, it didn�t happen.

CE: Yeah. Yeah. When you tell your story or when you give a talk at the Holocaust
Museum or whatever, does it then make you think more about it?

RM: Of course. This has been constant with me. I�ve written so much, I�ve given so
many�and as you saw in the papers, I try to vary it a little bit, not to give the same old


trite report. And one of the rules I learned, and probably you agree�definitely�is that
you start with a bang.

CE: Yes. You always do that in what you wrote. I love that.
RM: This I learned at the NSA. You start with a big bang, you know, and you keep the
interest of the people alive. If you start in�what should I say? The customary way.


CE: Like, �I was born in�� you know.
RM: Yes. It doesn�t excite anybody. Yeah.
CE: Yeah. That�s good. Is there anything you would like to leave the people with who


will be watching this video?
RM: I don�t understand.
CE: Is there any message that you would like to send.
RM: Oh. The message is, we survived. The ones who tell the story somehow survived,


with the help of God, of society, of human kindness, whatever it is, and we found quite a
bit of it�and we found some bad stuff, too.
CE: And I have at least one more question.


RM: Yes?
CE: In all the interviews that I�ve done, people have talked about having children and
their children having children, and that being kind of a way that, you know, we survived
and so forth. I think your girls are the only ones who have not had children�


RM: I guess so.



CE: �and I just wondered if you would talk about that.

RM: They�re not particularly interested, either. I don�t know why, because I�ve tried to
write down what�they�re not very interested. And they�re the only ones, I guess,
because I see others express their closeness. I�m close to them, but that doesn�t mean that
they�re interested in my past. I�m going to show you also a pan that we used, the
Sephardis used; the better one is at the Museum, the Holocaust Museum in St. Pete. But
this is a concoction with matzo.

CE: Okay.

RM: And it�s very interesting. I have the not so good one here�the better one I gave to
the Museum�but I said I need it back this Passover to make the dessert.

CE: Oh, okay. All right.

RM: I usually invite people over to taste this Sephardi dessert.

CE: Oh, wonderful. Is there anything else you want to say?

RM: I don�t know. What could I say? Sometimes I feel really very lucky that I had this
kind of life. And even the experiences through the Holocaust were helpful, because they
kind of shape you in a different way. I don�t think I�m very much like everybody else.
I�m not special, but I�m different, you see, because I have gone through all of that. You
develop a certain personality. I have recurring nightmares, though.

CE: Do you?

RM: Yes. Well, Parkinson�s makes you have nightmares and hallucinations, but mine is
always on the same theme. I�m afraid of something. I am afraid to go out; if I go out, I
take byways. I found myself fighting with somebody one night. I have scratched my
husband�s back one time because I was fighting against him. So I suppose it�s not all free,
it doesn�t come free. It�s a good story. It�s nice to talk about it so that it will become
known, but you pay a certain price for it.

CE: Thank you so much.


RM: You�re very welcome.
CE: I�ve thoroughly enjoyed getting to know you a little bit.
RM: Thank you.
CE: And hearing your story was very special.
RM: Thank you very much. Yeah, I don�t think I�m special, but this thing has made me


feel special.
CE: Oh, you are special, very special.
RM: And I�ll show you what I meant�what did I mean?
CE: Okay.
RM: The pot, and something else. I forget.
CE: We�ll think about it. Thank you very much.
RM: You�re very welcome.


End of interview
