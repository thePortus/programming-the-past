Ellen Klein: Today is June 30, 2010. I�m Ellen Klein, and I�m here today with survivor 
Ruth Lebowitz. We are in Redington Shores, Florida, in the United States of America.
Our language is English, and our videographers are Nafa Fa�alogo and Richard Schmidt.

I�m Ellen Klein, and I�m here today with Ruth Lebowitz. Today is June 30, 2010. And
this is tape one.

Okay. So, Ruth, will you tell us your full name?

Ruth Lebowitz: Yes, my name is Ruth Spingarn Lebowitz. My maiden name was
Spingarn, and my married name is Lebowitz.

EK: And how do you spell those?

RL: Spingarn is S-p-i-n-g-a-r-n. Lebowitz is L-e-b-o-w-i-t-z.

EK: And do you have a Hebrew name?

RL: My Hebrew name is Ruth. What is interesting is that when I was born in 1933, in
Breslau, Germany, this was right after Hitler had come into power there. And he made it a
requirement that all Jewish females be given the middle name of Sarah on their birth


certificates. So, it says on my birth certificate that my name is Ruth Sarah Spingarn, and
it really wasn�t until many, many years later�in fact, I was doing a college application,
and my father saw me filling it out and he said, �Why are you writing Ruth Sarah?� and I
said, �Isn�t that my name?� And that�s when I found out that that was not the name that
was given to me by my parents, but by the Nazi government.

EK: I see. Okay. And what were your parents� names?
RL: My father was Bruno Spingarn; my mother was Hedy Spingarn.
EK: Okay, and when were they born?
RL: My father was born in 1897, and my mother was born in�let�s see, 1910.
EK: Do you know the dates or the months?
RL: My father was June 2, 1897; my mother was November 9, 1910.
EK: And your date of birth is?
RL: November 2, 1933.
EK: Thirty-three [1933], okay. And you have two siblings, no?
RL: Yes, I do. I have a sister, Eva, and her name is Eva Rose; she had a middle name.


She�s a year and a half older than I am. And I have a brother, Karl, and he has no middle
name, but his birth certificate says Karl Israel Spingarn, because Jewish males had to
have the middle name of Israel.

EK: Okay. And do you know their dates of birth?
RL: Yes. My sister was�is (laughs)�May 7, let�s see, 1930. And my brother is February
19, 1931.



EK: Okay. So, tell me about�

RL: Whoops, I�m sorry. I�m sorry, that was wrong. Nineteen thirty-five; he�s younger
than I am.

EK: Okay. All right. So, tell me about your childhood.

RL: Well, I grew up in Breslau, Germany. By the way, that�s no longer Breslau, Germany;
it�s now Wroclaw, Poland, because after World War II the city was given back to Poland
as part of the Potsdam Treaty, and this was a part of Germany that was back and forth
between Poland and Germany. Now, I have heard that if you go back to Breslau,
everything is in Polish; it�s no longer in German. But anyway, that�s where I grew up. It
was, back then, a very cosmopolitan city. It was one of the largest in Germany, and my
father had a really large business there. We lived very, very comfortably. We left when I
was five, so my memories of a lot of things are very sketchy, but I do remember that I
had lots of aunts and uncles and cousins. It was a really very happy home. We lived well.
We had lots of family gatherings and parties, and these are the things that I remember.

As far as, well, the horrible things that were going, I was very much protected by that.
My sister, who is a year and a half older, has a lot more memories than I do because she
started school there and had some horrible experiences. I was very much sheltered by
that. For years, my sister Eva totally would not talk about anything, and I pieced things
together bit by bit. But my childhood experiences were really very good ones.

EK: And what kind of work did your father do?

RL: He had a tobacco, cigarette, candy wholesaling business. It was a pretty large
business; it was the largest in eastern Germany at the time. That was what he did.

EK: What do you remember about him? What kind of man was he?

RL: Oh, he was very kind. He was very much a family man. Afterwards, when we moved
to the United States, he was really very, very busy. He bought a grocery store in a small
town in upstate New York, and it was open six days a week. He was there twelve hours a
day. My sister and my brother and I all worked in the store, which we were not too
thrilled about, but there we were. It just�he became really very busy, but still, I have
very good memories of him.


EK: Tell me about your mother.

RL: My mother died in Germany in 1937. She developed a cold, it turned into
pneumonia, she had complications, and then, because she was Jewish, she was denied
medical treatment. And so, she died. It was quite traumatic for me. I was, well, about
three when she became ill; I was four when she died. It was something that was really
hard for me to accept, that all of a sudden, she wasn�t there anymore. I kept expecting
that she would come back and say, �Here I am! I�m fine!� but of course, that never
happened. Oh, as time went by, especially when my own child was born, I kept thinking
about really what I had missed, that I didn�t have a mother when I was growing up. And I
think my sister was affected that way, also. She once wrote me, �I so wish that Mother
was here, so she could really know how happy I am now.�

Anyhow�yeah, my mother died, and shortly thereafter, my father left the country. He
left because he had a friend who tipped him off that he saw his name on a Gestapo list,
and that it was unsafe for him to stay. So, my father was able to be smuggled out of
Germany. He was able to buy forged papers, and that was what made it possible for him
to leave. So then, when he got to the United States, he was able to send for my brother
and my sister and myself, and also my mother�s aunt, who had been taking care of us all
of this time. Most of my relatives, my aunts and uncles and cousins, just were scattered
all over. They started calling and wiring my father to please help, because you couldn�t
get into the United States without proper papers, without visas. So, without those, most of
them did perish, and that was something that haunted my father really forever, that he
was not able to bring out more. As I said, he had a large family; he had a lot of brothers
and sisters.

One of my aunts and uncles and my cousin went to Shanghai, because that was�China
was a country where visas were not required to get in, so there were a lot of people who
went there. They went to Shanghai, and then when the Japanese occupied Shanghai, the
family was put into an internment camp, where his parents died of typhoid. He was there
by himself as a teenager, and then after the war my father was able to bring him to the
United States.

EK: What was his name?

RL: Claude Spingarn. He�s retired in Arizona now, and he speaks at gatherings and talks
about his experiences as a Shanghailander. They have frequent get-togethers and reunions
of the people who were in Shanghai during the war. I have another aunt and uncle who
were sent to�well, they went to Holland, but they weren�t safe there for long because


when the Nazis occupied Holland they were rounded up. My aunt was sent to
Theresienstadt; she actually survived. My uncle died there. My cousin, Hans, survived,
and my father was able to bring him to the United States. He died a few years ago, but he
actually was reunited with a young girl that he had met in Holland fifty-five years
previously, and they were able to get together and that was really a happy occasion for
everybody. I have another aunt and uncle who went to Palestine, and one of my cousins
was an officer in the British Navy. His younger brother, my cousin Johannan, was in the
Haganah, then was in Israeli intelligence.

I mean, I could go on and on with my family, because each of them really has their own
story to tell. Most of my aunts and uncles perished.

EK: And all of these that you�ve been telling us about were siblings of your father, right?

RL: Yes. Yes, yes.

EK: And how many siblings did he have?

RL: You know, honestly I don�t remember. I really don�t.

EK: That�s okay.

RL: My sister knows all of these. She can tell you all of the family history. But I just have
vague recollections.

EK: That�s all right. So, tell me about�tell me a little bit about religious life before the
war, and a little bit after. Were your parents observant? What do you remember about
Jewish culture and about socializing as you were growing up? Tell me a little bit about
the communal aspects.

RL: Okay. Well, in Germany, I know that we were very much a part of the Jewish life
there. We belonged to one of the synagogues there, although I don�t really remember that
much about it. I do remember that on Friday nights when we lit the candles that we had to
pull all of the drapes and the curtains, and we had heavy drapes put in. I didn�t know why,
at the time. I mean, this is part of my finding out bits and pieces afterwards, because
nobody told me. They just told me, �Don�t go near the window, and don�t pull on the


drapes.� It was my sister who told me afterwards it was because they didn�t want anyone
to see that the candles were lit on Friday night.

My sister, when she started school, went to first grade in Breslau. She went to a Hebrew
day school, until it was burned down. It was a new synagogue there, and there was a
Hebrew school attached to it. She did tell me, years and years later, about going there one
morning and seeing everything burned. The outer walls were left, but the roof was
completely gone. She said that she will forever remember that sky that was there, where
the big hole was. She said that she remembers that there was a big pile of books burning
in the courtyard, and two SS men were dragging out the rabbi, who was her teacher, and
he was beaten and bloodied. It was quite a horrible sight.

She said that, after that, they went to school in an abandoned aircraft carrier�hangar, I
mean�and they were there until it was too dangerous. There were two Jewish schools
that were using that hangar. Her school was there for half the day and another school was
there the other half, and they would have older children looking out to make sure that
nobody was following them. She said that they were also taught different phrases in three
different languages, so that if they were stopped by anybody who was asking them where
they were going, they would have appropriate comments. They were taught that, and she
really has horrible nightmares about that, thinking about, well, what happens if somebody
stops her, and what will she say and what happens if she has the wrong answer. I didn�t
know any of this, at the time. She never told me, until so many years later.

EK: Do you remember what the phrases were? Did she tell you what it was?

RL: No. It�s very hard to get her to talk. She really won�t, and just at times she�ll tell me
bits and pieces. But no, I don�t know. She also said they took different routes to school,
because they didn�t want anybody to notice that there were groups of children coming the
same�you know, coming and going the same way. So sometimes, it took hours to get
back and forth, and finally they just stopped because it got to be too dangerous. That was
her experience of first grade. I was home having fun. Nobody told me a thing. So, our
experiences were completely different. Anyway, that was Breslau.

EK: Now, once your father left, and he left you with your great-aunt, how long were you
there? What was that experience like, and what do you remember about that?

RL: What I remember was that after�well, yeah, just before he left, he arranged for us to
go to camp in Switzerland. We were there for several months; I don�t even remember
how long. It was really a beautiful camp. We went skiing. I hated it. I hate the idea of
going there, and what I remember is giving my father a very, very hard time. I remember


he sat next to me on the train, I was crying the whole way over, saying, �Why do I have
to go? What�s going on?� Afterwards, I just thought, �Oh, my God, what a hard time I
gave him.� I really didn�t understand. I didn�t know what was going on. Anyway, we
were there for a while, and then�

EK: Tell me about that. Where was this in Switzerland? Do you know?

RL: No, I don�t. I don�t.

EK: What do you remember about the camp? That�s a long time to be there.

RL: It was difficult, because I wasn�t used to a regimen. I mean, I was used to pretty
much coming and going as I pleased, and you know, we had to have meals at a certain
hour and go to bed at a certain hour, and I just had a very difficult time getting used to it.
I was forever having to go the bathroom in the middle of the night, and we weren�t
supposed to get up, so one of the older children would take pity and lead me to the
bathroom because I didn�t know my way there, or I didn�t know my way back. To me, it
was really a horrible experience, but it was probably not a bad experience at all. But that
was�

EK: So, who came to get you from camp?

RL: My great-aunt.

EK: Okay. And then you went to stay with her, and she was living also in Breslau?

RL: Oh, yes. Yeah, uh-huh. Yes.

EK: And then how long were you with her, then, and tell me about that.

RL: It�s one of the things I don�t remember. Really, I don�t.

EK: And she travelled with you?



RL: Yes, she did. Yeah.

EK: So at some point, then, you received permission to leave.

RL: Oh, yes, yes. My father was able to arrange for visas for us. He just regretted that he
couldn�t get more, but he was a recent immigrant himself, so that there was very little that
he could do for as many people as he wanted to. But he was able to arrange for our
passage, and then we sailed.

EK: And what do you remember about that?

RL: It was a great trip. Again, my experiences were really, really good.

EK: When did you leave?

RL: It was actually September 1939, a week before Hitler invaded Poland. And so, ours
was the very last ship that was allowed to leave Germany. So it�s amazing timing, as far
as I�m concerned, because any later and we wouldn�t have been able to go. Also, just a
few days after we got to the United States, I started school, because September was a new
school year. We settled in a small town called Brockport, New York, which is between
Rochester and Buffalo. My father had really spent a lot of time looking for a safe place
for us, someplace where he could make a living. There was a grocery store for sale there;
he bought it, and that was where we went.

EK: What do you remember about that first day of school? That couldn�t have been easy.

RL: No, it was very�it was very strange. I was really very bewildered, not knowing the
language. Actually, we had been preparing in Germany by learning English�I mean, we
knew we were coming, so we were learning English. So, I was able to know a little.
There were things, though, that constantly bewildered me, and I really had no one to ask
at the time things were happening. For example, the school was an old building, and the
bathrooms were in the basement. So, whenever we went to the bathroom, the teacher
would say, �We�re going to the basement.� It was years before I realized that the word for
�bathroom� was not �basement�! And then, also, I was just learning to read then, and I
would read everything in sight and I�d look over in the newspapers, and they would have
basement sales and I just was totally bewildered. What on Earth is this? You know, things
like that. It was difficult.


But a big plus for me was it was first grade, I wasn�t older, and so we were learning to
read. That was a big saving grace. The way that they taught reading then in first grade
was with flash cards, you know, Dick and Jane and all that stuff. I really was very good at
it, and so people were constantly bringing in people to watch me read. I had no idea what
I was reading, but I knew all the words, so that was good.

EK: What was it like in the community, to come and to join another community? Was
there a Jewish community then in the town?

RL: No, there was not. We were the only Jewish family. It was a small town, about 5,000.
However, it was a college town, so that made it quite interesting. But still, in all, I always
felt very alienated. In general, people regarded us as German enemy aliens, rather than
Jewish refugees, and growing up I could never understand why they didn�t realize the
difference, but there it was. My clothes were different. I wore typical European things,
the woolen stockings that little girls in Germany wore, you know, that nobody wore in the
United States. So, it was not particularly easy.

EK: Did you have friends?

RL: Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.

EK: And how were the teachers with you?

RL: Some were very good, some weren�t. I really took it in stride. I thought, well, that�s
the way it is: some teachers are nice and some aren�t. My sister, who was two years ahead
of me in school, was much, much more sensitive to that. She really felt in many cases that
she wasn�t treated very well. Eventually, what my sister Eva did is become a bilingual
teacher and administrator in the Los Angeles School District. She was in one of the worst
neighborhoods in the city, but she loved those kids, she really did. She emphasized�she
realized how they felt, and she was bound and determined, she always said to me, that
nobody in any of her classes would ever go through what she went through. So, that was
a big success for her.

EK: That�s very beautiful.

RL: Well, let�s see, what else can I say?


EK: Tell me about your life, then, since.

RL: Since? Well, okay. Well, I grew up in Brockport. I also went to college in Brockport,
became a teacher, and moved to New York. That was where I met my husband; my
husband�s from Brooklyn. We got married and settled in Queens, New York. I have one
daughter. We have been quite happy and then, ten years ago, retired to Florida. My
husband passed away last year. He was ill with Parkinson�s, so he is no longer here. But
in general, life has been good. My daughter lives in Orlando; she�s married and
celebrating her twenty-fifth anniversary next month. And my granddaughters both go to
Florida universities, and one of them is graduating next month. So, things are good. My
brother became an engineer and moved to California, and had really a very successful
career. My sister, as I said, was in the Los Angeles school system. So, I�m glad that my
father lived to see all of that.

So, right now, I�m a volunteer at the Florida Holocaust Museum, and this is something
that I really feel I have an obligation to do just for my family, for all of the people who
perished. I really think that this is a remarkable opportunity here, to tell the story and to
let future generations know what happened. So, I�m really grateful to you for this
opportunity.

EK: Thank you. Thank you.
